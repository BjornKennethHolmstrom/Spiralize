# Björn Kenneth Holmström

Björn is a Swedish polymath working at the intersection of Spiral Dynamics, systems change, and ethical AI. He created Spiralize.org and founded Fjärilspartiet, a political movement grounded in developmental thinking and planetary care. 

With a background in engineering physics and optimization, he now focuses on designing tools for personal and societal transformation. His work includes SharedSpheres, CommuniTree, and the Global Governance Framework.

Björn draws from a deeply spiritual path shaped by mysticism, yoga, and radical life choices. He believes our greatest potential lies in honoring complexity with compassion—and aligning thought, tech, and soul for the good of all.
