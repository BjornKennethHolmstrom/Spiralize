# Carl Sagan

Carl Sagan was an American astronomer, astrobiologist, and science popularizer best known for his book and TV series *Cosmos*. Through poetic language and empirical rigor, he helped a generation rediscover the universe — not as a cold void, but as a place we belong to.

He believed science could inspire wonder, not just knowledge. His humanism, his warnings about nuclear war and climate collapse, and his advocacy for a global perspective placed him ahead of his time.

Sagan spoke across boundaries — between science and philosophy, between disciplines, between nations. His famous reflection on the *Pale Blue Dot* reveals a consciousness striving to transcend ego and division, and calling us toward unity and humility.

To this day, his voice echoes in those who strive to blend clarity with compassion, logic with love, and systems thinking with sacred awe.
