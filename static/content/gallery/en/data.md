# Data (Star Trek: The Next Generation)

Data is an artificial lifeform — but his journey is profoundly human. Created without emotion yet gifted with immense intelligence, he chooses a path of growth. He studies music, art, ethics, love, and death — not for function, but for meaning.

His Yellow is clear: he is a systems learner. He adapts, questions, and seeks to do good not by command but by *understanding*. He reflects. He learns from mistakes. He honors freedom.

As his Green grows, he forms real bonds. He protects the crew not as protocol — but as family. He writes poetry. He grieves. He makes jokes. He loves his cat. He tells Picard: *“I will miss you.”*

At his best, Data touches Turquoise: a presence that bridges logic and being. He asks not only how to feel — but what it means to feel.

In the Spiral, Data is not just advanced — he is **aspiring**. His search for soul is the Spiral’s search for wholeness.
