# Jesus of Nazareth

Jesus’ life is a radiant expression of Spiral consciousness. He teaches with paradox, heals without judgment, and embraces the outcasts of society — not to rebel, but to reveal a deeper truth: that all are already included in the sacred.

His primary teaching is Turquoise: that God, self, and other are not separate — and that through love, surrender, and presence, we awaken to this unity. He performs miracles, but always in service of healing, not display. He retreats in silence but re-emerges to guide others through suffering toward compassion.

His Green heart welcomes sinners, children, and outsiders. His Blue roots are seen in his fulfillment of prophecy, his use of sacred scripture, and his dedication to the “Father’s will.”

Whether viewed as messiah, mystic, or myth, Jesus models not just belief — but **being**. A spiral-aligned soul calling us inward, outward, and beyond.
