# Sephiroth

Sephiroth was once a celebrated hero — a symbol of discipline, strength, and elite purpose. He shined with Orange excellence: logical, skilled, composed. He fought for order and mission.

But then came the fracture.

When he learns the truth — or what he believes is truth — his identity implodes. Blue collapses. Orange becomes hollow. And into that void, Coral shadow rushes in.

He doesn’t just want revenge. He wants **apotheosis**. He fuses with the planet’s will, speaks as destiny, reshapes his ego into divinity. In Coral’s light form, the self dissolves into wholeness. In shadow, it expands to consume it.

Sephiroth becomes Spiral shadow incarnate — the danger of unchecked brilliance, the fury of betrayed purpose, the temptation of symbolic self-deification.

He isn’t simply evil. He is the Spiral’s dark mirror, asking:
> *“What happens when your greatness forgets its source?”*
