# Vegeta (early DBZ)

Vegeta, prince of the Saiyans, enters Dragon Ball Z with one goal: total supremacy. He measures worth by strength, demands loyalty through fear, and crushes the weak without hesitation. His pride is monumental, his ego easily wounded — and his default response is violence.

He embodies the classic Stage Red worldview: the strong survive, the weak perish. Morality is irrelevant, compassion is weakness, and domination is destiny.

Though his character evolves dramatically later in the series, early Vegeta is a raw, unfiltered expression of Red consciousness: reactive, impulsive, and willing to destroy worlds for his own glory.

His arc is one of the clearest examples in anime of a character who begins in Red and gradually integrates higher stages through struggle, defeat, and connection.
