# Laozi

Laozi (or Lao Tzu) is the legendary author of the *Tao Te Ching* and founder of Taoist philosophy. His teachings express a profound attunement to the natural world, the subtle flow of existence, and the art of effortless action — *wu wei*.

He does not preach, control, or seek followers. Instead, he speaks in riddles, analogies, and gentle inversions. For Laozi, strength lies in softness, wisdom in not-knowing, and leadership in stepping back.

His essence is Ultra-Violet — transparent, detached, and non-defensive. His presence teaches without effort. His guidance dissolves the guide.

Turquoise flows through his metaphors, his respect for nature, and his intuitive synthesis of opposites. He offers holistic integration without attachment.

And in his silences, we glimpse Clear — a stage where even paradox disappears, and there is no more need to speak. Just Tao.
