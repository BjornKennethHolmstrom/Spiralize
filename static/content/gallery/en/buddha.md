# Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha)

The Buddha’s life is a model of deep inner evolution. Born into privilege, he confronted suffering head-on and renounced comfort to seek truth. His path led him beyond ego, beyond even the soul, into a realization of *emptiness* and *non-clinging*.

His teachings — like the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path — are Yellow in their clarity and elegance, Turquoise in their compassion and holistic aim, and Ultra-Violet in their dissolving of all identity into awareness itself.

To meet the Buddha on the road is to meet your own image of awakening — and to let it go. The truth cannot be clung to. Even “Buddha” must be released.

He reminds us: reality cannot be owned, only lived. And liberation is not what we gain, but what we stop grasping.
