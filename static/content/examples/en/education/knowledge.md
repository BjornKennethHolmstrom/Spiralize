# Knowledge Systems Examples

## <stage:beige>

### Practical Instinctive Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Immediate, embodied, non-verbal; passed through necessity and observation

Knowledge is limited to what can help the group survive right now.

**Examples:**
- Knowing where water or shelter can be found
- Remembering which berries are edible based on taste and reaction
- No conceptual abstraction or formal transmission

## <stage:purple>

### Mythic and Ancestral Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Transmitted through stories, rituals, dreams; based on sacred tradition

Knowledge is preserved and legitimized by the ancestors and spirit realm.

**Examples:**
- Creation myths encoding ecological wisdom
- Totemic lore as moral guidance
- Ritual knowledge passed from elder to apprentice

## <stage:red>

### Assertive and Power-Based Knowledge

**Characteristics:** What is said by the strong or divine-seeming is considered true

Truth is claimed and enforced, not questioned or verified.

**Examples:**
- Warrior codes proclaimed by leaders
- Intuitive knowing framed as absolute
- Suppression of competing views as heresy or weakness

## <stage:blue>

### Doctrinal and Authoritative Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Truth revealed by sacred texts or formal institutions; validated by tradition

Knowledge is clear, hierarchical, and unchanging.

**Examples:**
- Religious scriptures and catechisms
- Classical educational curricula
- Memorization of fixed historical and moral truths

## <stage:orange>

### Empirical and Scientific Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Data-driven, hypothesis-tested, repeatable, objectified

Knowledge is valued for its predictive power and utility.

**Examples:**
- Scientific method and peer review
- Textbooks, encyclopedias, and academic publishing
- STEM disciplines as truth benchmarks

## <stage:green>

### Experiential and Relativistic Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Truth as plural, personal, cultural; all voices matter

Knowledge is shared and shaped through dialogue and felt understanding.

**Examples:**
- Oral histories and personal narratives
- Multicultural and intersectional studies
- Collaborative knowledge creation in community settings

## <stage:yellow>

### Integrative and Meta-Systemic Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Functional synthesis, cross-paradigm awareness, dynamic modeling

Yellow values understanding across perspectives, not fixed truths.

**Examples:**
- Systems thinking and integral theory
- Meta-disciplinary frameworks
- Learning how different knowledge systems interact

## <stage:turquoise>

### Planetary and Holistic Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Knowledge as service to life; inner and outer worlds unified

Turquoise sees knowing as embedded in life, not separate from it.

**Examples:**
- Indigenous ecological wisdom integrated with science
- Earth-centered cosmovisions
- Meditation and intuition as valid epistemologies

## <stage:coral>

### Evolutionary and Co-Creative Knowledge

**Characteristics:** Emergent, sovereign, catalytic; truth as invitation to transform

Coral knowledge is shaped in the dance between form and chaos.

**Examples:**
- Intuition tested through reality feedback
- Learning through co-created experiments
- Truth as evolving catalyst rather than fixed object

## <stage:ultraviolet>

### Transparent Knowing and Resonant Fields

**Characteristics:** Truth as direct transmission; wordless, fluid, embodied

Knowledge flows through presence and silence rather than structure.

**Examples:**
- Tuning into collective knowing without needing to ask
- Subtle energetic recognition (“this feels true”)
- Knowing without knower

## <stage:clear>

### No-Knowledge, Just Being

**Characteristics:** No separation between knower and known; truth as unfolding reality

At Clear, knowledge dissolves — there is no need to know, only to be.

**Examples:**
- Action arising without justification
- Insight without concept or language
- Truth is not learned, it is lived
