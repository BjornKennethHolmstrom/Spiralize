# Corporate Cultures Examples

## <stage:beige>

### Survival-Mode Organizations

**Characteristics:** Chaotic, short-term focused, minimal coordination, individual survival over collective goals

Beige corporate cultures exist temporarily during collapse or extreme hardship.

**Examples:**
- Informal economies during disaster zones
- Companies in total bankruptcy survival mode
- Scavenger-like startups in hostile, lawless markets

## <stage:purple>

### Clan-Based Corporate Cultures

**Characteristics:** Family loyalty, insider favoritism, tradition-bound operations

Purple organizations are built around kinship, loyalty, and insider trust.

**Examples:**
- Traditional family-owned businesses with leadership passed through generations
- Mafia-run business fronts (family above all)
- Small village cooperatives tightly tied to lineage and tradition

## <stage:red>

### Power-Driven and Authoritarian Cultures

**Characteristics:** Dominance hierarchies, loyalty through fear, charisma of strong leaders

Red organizations operate through force, intimidation, and personal loyalty.

**Examples:**
- Early-stage autocratic tech founders who control all decisions
- Hostile, cutthroat sales floors valuing aggression over collaboration
- Fiction: Tyrell Corporation (*Blade Runner*) — cold power-driven hierarchy

## <stage:blue>

### Bureaucratic and Rule-Based Cultures

**Characteristics:** Hierarchical, orderly, obedience to established rules and roles

Blue organizations create predictability through structured bureaucracy and shared codes of conduct.

**Examples:**
- Traditional government agencies (e.g., IRS, DMV)
- Legacy manufacturing giants (e.g., General Motors mid-20th century)
- Religious-affiliated enterprises with strict internal structures

## <stage:orange>

### Achievement-Oriented and Competitive Cultures

**Characteristics:** Results-driven, innovation prized, meritocracy promoted (at least in theory)

Orange organizations prioritize measurable success, innovation, and personal ambition.

**Examples:**
- Google’s early culture of "20% free time for innovation"
- Investment banks like Goldman Sachs
- Competitive law firms and consultancies
- Fiction: Weyland-Yutani (*Alien*) — profit maximization at all costs

## <stage:green>

### Collaborative and Values-Driven Cultures

**Characteristics:** Inclusivity, emotional safety, consensus-based decision making

Green organizations emphasize people, purpose, and well-being alongside profits.

**Examples:**
- Patagonia ("We're in business to save our home planet.")
- Ben & Jerry’s socially responsible business model
- Worker cooperatives with democratic governance
- Fiction: Societies depicted in *Solarpunk* visions

## <stage:yellow>

### Adaptive and Systems-Conscious Cultures

**Characteristics:** Functional self-organization, contextual leadership, long-term systemic thinking

Yellow organizations flexibly adapt structure based on functional needs rather than rigid hierarchy.

**Examples:**
- Holacracy-run companies like early Zappos experiments
- Platform cooperatives blending technology and social value creation
- Innovation hubs emphasizing experimentation and systemic learning
- Fiction: "The Culture" society by Iain M. Banks — adaptive AI-human organizations

## <stage:turquoise>

### Planetary Stewardship Cultures

**Characteristics:** Integration of spiritual, ecological, and systemic awareness into operations

Turquoise organizations operate as conscious nodes within larger planetary systems.

**Examples:**
- B-Corps expanding toward regenerative models (not just "do less harm")
- Organizations fully embedding SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) in core DNA
- Earth-focused tech communities linking nature, consciousness, and technology

## <stage:coral>

### Sovereign Evolutionary Enterprise Cultures

**Characteristics:** Dynamic co-evolution, sovereign collaboration, catalyzing emergent futures

Coral organizations embody fluid sovereignty — able to lead, follow, or dissolve dynamically depending on need.

**Examples:**
- Highly decentralized innovation networks with emergent leadership
- Regenerative fractal organizations evolving continuously
- Fiction: Dreamlike, evolving guilds in *Anathem* by Neal Stephenson

## <stage:ultraviolet>

### Transparent Presence-Based Organizations

**Characteristics:** Minimal structure, effortless self-alignment through field resonance

Ultra-Violet organizations dissolve traditional boundaries, functioning through spontaneous presence and natural coherence.

**Examples:**
- Temporary intentional gatherings where leadership arises moment-to-moment
- Organizations operating through silent mutual attunement without formal meetings
- Dream societies in speculative fiction where needs are known and met without planning

## <stage:clear>

### Beyond Organizations: Pure Emergent Co-Being

**Characteristics:** No organizations, no hierarchy, no structure — only presence and arising necessity

At Clear, "corporate culture" dissolves — there is only what arises naturally in service to life itself.

**Examples:**
- Informal gatherings that appear, fulfill a purpose, and vanish without trace
- Life lived through direct mutual seeing and spontaneous co-creation
- No separate economic or business layer — only being expressing itself
