- Classical religious hierarchies (e.g., Catholic Church)

Orange organizations are designed for efficiency and innovation.

**Examples:**

## <stage:coral>

### Fractal Sovereign Networks

**Characteristics:** Autonomous nodes co-creating, polarity-held leadership, generative governance

Coral organizations evolve like creative organisms.

**Examples:**
- Dynamic evolution labs
- Organizations that oscillate between form and formlessness
- Sovereign collectives holding paradox through shared purpose

## <stage:ultraviolet>

### Presence-Based Co-Emergence

**Characteristics:** No predefined roles; leadership arises moment-to-moment from collective resonance

**Examples:**
- Silent councils of attuned beings
- Spontaneous creative gatherings
- Leadership passed like a breath between participants

## <stage:clear>
