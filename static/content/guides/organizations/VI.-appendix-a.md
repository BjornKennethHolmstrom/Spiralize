### Scoring and Interpretation

For each stage, calculate the percentage score:
- (Total score Ã· 25) Ã— 100 = % expression of this stage

#### Interpreting Your Results:

**Center of Gravity**: The stage(s) with the highest percentage represents your organization or community's center of gravity.

**Developmental Range**: Stages scoring above 60% represent significant expressions in your organization/community.

**Developmental Gaps**: Stages scoring below 40% may represent underdeveloped capacities.

**Healthy Balance**: A healthy organization typically shows strength in its center of gravity plus the stages immediately before and after it.

### Departmental/Team Variation Analysis

Use this template to map developmental differences across your organization:

| Department/Team | Purple % | Red % | Blue % | Orange % | Green % | Yellow % | Turquoise % | Center of Gravity |

### Qualitative Assessment Questions

Beyond the quantitative scores, consider these questions:

1. What stories, symbols, and language patterns reveal your developmental makeup?

2. Where do you observe tensions or conflicts that might have developmental roots?

3. Which stages are explicitly valued and which might be marginalized in your culture?

4. How has your developmental center of gravity shifted over time?

5. What developmental capacities might you need to strengthen to address current challenges?
