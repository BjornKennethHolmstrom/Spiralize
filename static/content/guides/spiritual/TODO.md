You're absolutely right - that's a comprehensive list, and creating all those documents would be a significant undertaking. Let's prioritize the most essential tools and resources that would provide the greatest value to users of your Spiral Dynamics guide.

# Prioritized TODO List for Spiralize.org

## Top Priority (Essential Foundation)
1. **`/guide-spiritual/tools/spiral-diagnostics.md`** - This is referenced throughout the entire guide and serves as the entry point for users to locate themselves on the spiral.

[  ][  ][  ][xx]

2. **`/guide-spiritual/tools/shadow-journal.md`** - Frequently referenced across all stages and crucial for integration work.

4. **`/guide-spiritual/appendices/states-vs-stages.md`** - Fundamental conceptual distinction that helps prevent common misunderstandings.

## Medium Priority (Core Enhancement)
5. **Practice Trackers** - Start with just one template that can be adapted:
   - **`/guide-spiritual/tools/practice-trackers/template-tracker.md`** (with instructions for stage-specific adaptation)

6. **`/guide-spiritual/tools/finding-support.md`** - Helping people find professional guidance when needed is important for ethical responsibility.

7. **`/guide-spiritual/tools/discernment-guide.md`** - Distinguishing between spiritual emergency and mental health crisis (safety consideration).

8. **Stage-Specific Ethics Tools** - Pick the most commonly referenced:
   - **`/guide-spiritual/tools/fierce-compassion.md`** (Green)
   - **`/guide-spiritual/tools/innovation-ethics.md`** (Orange)

## Lower Priority (Additional Value)
9. **Modern Application Tools**:
   - **`/guide-spiritual/tools/digital-detox.md`** (practical and widely applicable)
 DS  CG  Gr  Cl

   - **`/guide-spiritual/practices/kitchen-retreats.md`** (accessible everyday practice)
 DS  CG  Gr  Cl

10. **`/guide-spiritual/tools/universal-adapter.md`** - Helps users customize practices across stages.
 DS  CG  Gr  Cl

11. **`/guide-spiritual/tools/boundary-setting`** - Widely applicable across multiple stages.
 DS  CG  Gr  Cl

## Considerations for Prioritization

I've prioritized based on these principles:

1. **Foundational resources** that are repeatedly referenced across the guide
2. **Safety-related tools** for helping people navigate crises
3. **High-leverage tools** that can be adapted across multiple stages
4. **Practical resources** that help apply the concepts in everyday life

This approach gives you 11 key documents to focus on rather than the original 50+. You can always expand later if there's interest and energy, but these core tools would provide a solid foundation for your guide.
