# Integration Tools  
*Stitching Soul and System Back Together*  

---

## **Getting Started**
Integration can feel overwhelming. Start small:  
- **Listen**: Which part of you—body, heart, or mind—needs attention?  
- **Choose**: Pick one tool that feels approachable.  
- **Rest**: It's okay to pause and simply be.  

**Tool Chooser Prompt**  
Journal: *"Which part of me is loudest right now—body, heart, or mind? Start there."*  

**Integration Elements**: A tree with roots (somatic practices), trunk (mental frameworks), and branches (emotional processes) - symbolizing how all dimensions of healing must work together. The falling colored leaves represent stage-specific experiences being integrated back into soil, completing the cycle of growth.

### **When to Apply These Tools**
- After a spiritual emergency or dark night
