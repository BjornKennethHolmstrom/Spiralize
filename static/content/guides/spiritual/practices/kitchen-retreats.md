## **Why the Kitchen is Your Best Ashram**  
The kitchen concentrates all spiritual challenges:  
- **Beige**: Raw hunger meets civilized restraint  
- **Purple**: Ancestral recipes whisper family karma  
- **Red**: Knives test your edge between skill and harm  
- **Turquoise**: The onionâ€™s layers mirror cosmic fractals  

> ***"If you can stay present while the rice burns, you can stay present anywhere."***
