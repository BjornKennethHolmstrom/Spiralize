I believe this synthesis retains the strengths of all three outlines while adding:

1. More explicit connection between stages and spiritual expressions
2. Greater emphasis on integration across stages rather than pure transcendence
3. More nuanced treatment of shadow elements at each stage
4. Stronger ethical framing around spiritual development
5. More accessible structure for readers at different stages

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular section or aspect of this outline?
