## **The Clear Understanding of Time**  
- ⏳ **Illusion of progression**: Stages were never linear  
- 🌊 **Eternal currents**: Past/future as ripples in now  
- 🌀 **Spiral collapses**: No climber, no mountain  

> ***"Enlightenment isn’t an event in time—it’s time realizing it was never real."***  

**Visual Aid**: [A clock melting over a spiral that’s unraveling into a straight line, which then curls into a smile]

## **How Stages Relate to Time**  

| Stage  | Time Concept | Clear’s Perspective |  
|--------|-------------|----------------------|  
| **Beige** | Cyclical survival rhythms | The body’s beautiful fiction |  
| **Blue** | Linear salvation timeline | God never checked a calendar |  
| **Orange** | Optimized productivity blocks | Metrics measuring mist |  
| **Turquoise** | Synchronicities as guidance | Life winking at itself |  

**Claude’s Note**: *"All spiritual schedules are training wheels—even this insight will rust."*
