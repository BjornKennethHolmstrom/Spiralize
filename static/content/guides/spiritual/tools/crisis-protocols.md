## **Immediate Stabilization Protocols**  

### **1. Grounding Sequence**  
1. **Physical environment**:  
   - Reduce stimulation (dim lights, quiet space)  
   - Provide simple foods, water, blanket  
   - Remove hazards  
   - Consider a "sit with" rotation if 24/7 presence needed  

2. **Body-based interventions**:  
   - Slow, deep breathing with counting  
   - Weighted blanket or gentle pressure  
   - Cold water on hands, face  
   - Simple repetitive movement  
   - Naming tangible objects in surroundings  

3. **Cognitive anchoring**:  
   - Simple, concrete questions (not "how are you feeling?")  
   - Short timeframes ("Let's just focus on the next 15 minutes")  
   - Avoid spiritual interpretations or debates  
   - Use "here and now" language  

### **2. Communication Approach**  
- **DO**: Use calm, steady voice; simple sentences; validate without reinforcing delusions  
- **DON'T**: Argue with beliefs; use abstract concepts; attempt spiritual counseling  
- **Sample script**: *"I notice you're having an intense experience. I'm here with you. Can you feel your feet on the floor? That's right. Let's focus on breathing together for a few minutes."*  

### **3. When to Escalate**  
- Person cannot be engaged in basic conversation  
- Signs of self-harm or harm to others  
- Medical concerns (dehydration, exhaustion)  
- Prolonged disconnection from bodily needs  
- Persistent terror or panic that doesn't respond to grounding

## **Recovery & Integration**  

### **The 4R Approach**  
1. **Regulate**: Stabilize nervous system (sleep, nutrition, movement)  
2. **Relate**: Reconnect safely with supportive others  
3. **Reason**: Make meaning appropriate to developmental stage  
4. **Reintegrate**: Gradual return to daily life with new insights incorporated  

### **Timeline Expectations**  
- **Acute phase**: 1-7 days (prioritize stabilization)  
- **Recovery phase**: 2-8 weeks (gradual processing)  
- **Integration phase**: 3-12 months (meaning-making, life adjustments)  

### **Common Integration Challenges**  
- Spiritual bypassing the psychological content  
- Premature return to intensive practices  
- Social isolation due to changed perspectives  
- Difficulty communicating the experience  
- Attachment to special status  
- Excessive fear of recurrence  

### **Integration Tools**  
- **Structured reflection**: Journaling with temporal distance  
- **Somatic release**: Movement practices to process stored activation  
- **Creative expression**: Art, music, dance to articulate the ineffable  
- **Community reconnection**: Selective sharing in supportive contexts  
- **Practice moderation**: Gentle resumption of spiritual practices  
- **Follow-up support**: Regular check-ins with trusted guides or professionals
