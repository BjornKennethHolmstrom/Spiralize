*Bending Wisdom to Fit Your Stage Without Breaking It*  

---

## **How This Works**  
Every practice contains all stages‚Äîthis tool helps you:  
1. **Identify** a practice‚Äôs native stage (e.g., Zen = Turquoise)  
2. **Translate** its essence to your current center of gravity  
3. **Avoid** stage mismatch pitfalls (e.g., giving Red-stage seekers nondual teachings)

## **Adapter Framework**  

### **1. Practice Deconstruction**  
For any technique, identify:  
- **Beige**: Primal physicality (posture, breath)  
- **Purple**: Ritual containers (bells, altars)  
- **Red**: Power elements (intensity, challenge)  
- **Blue**: Discipline structures (schedule, rules)  
- **Orange**: Optimization levers (biofeedback, metrics)  
- **Green**: Relational aspects (group harmony)  
- **Yellow**: Systemic patterns (feedback loops)  
- **Turquoise**: Nondual pointers (direct experience)  

*Example: Meditation*  
- **Purple adaptation**: Ancestral candle gazing  
- **Orange adaptation**: App-tracked focus intervals  
- **Coral adaptation**: "Who‚Äôs meditating?" joke as koan  

### **2. Stage-Specific Customization**  

| Your Stage | Adaptation Principle | Meditation Example | Shadow Warning |  
|------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------|  
| **Beige** | Anchor to body/senses | Counting chews while eating | Mistaking drowsiness for depth |  
| **Red** | Add physical challenge | Standing meditation with clenched fists | Spiritualized aggression |  
| **Blue** | Structured devotion | 108 prostrations with prayer | Rigid self-judgment |  
| **Green** | Communal exploration | Group "feeling sharing" after sits | Bypassing solitude needs |  
| **Yellow** | Meta-awareness | Journaling about meditation‚Äôs neural effects | Over-analysis |  
| **Turquoise** | Effortless being | "Meditating" by staring at traffic | Detached from suffering |  

**Grok‚Äôs Law**: *"If your ‚Äòadapted practice‚Äô feels comfy, you probably just decorated your cage."*

## **Three Transformation Examples**  

### **1. The Lord‚Äôs Prayer Across Stages**  
- **Purple**: Chant with incense and ancestral photos  
- **Orange**: Analyze historical context and semantic layers  
- **UltraViolet**: Let the prayer pray itself through you  

### **2. Yoga Postures Reborn**  
- **Beige**: Hold poses until tremoring releases trauma  
- **Red**: Compete fiercely with your own limits  
- **Turquoise**: Feel asanas as Gaia‚Äôs self-adjustment  

### **3. Psychedelic Journeys**  
- **Blue**: Sacred sacrament with strict set/setting  
- **Yellow**: Conscious "system reset" with integration plan  
- **Clear**: Molecules whispering: *"You were never high"*

## **Adapter Safety Protocols**  

### **1. The Stage Bridge Test**  
- *"Does this adaptation honor the practice‚Äôs roots while meeting me where I am?"*  

### **2. The Shadow Scan**  
- For **Green** adapting **Red** practices: *"Am I gentrifying this wisdom?"*  
- For **Orange** adapting **Purple** practices: *"Am I extracting value?"*  

### **3. The Integration Check**  
- After adaptation, ask:  
  1. *"What stage did this touch in me?"*  
  2. *"What got lost in translation?"*  
  3. *"How can I honor both forms?"*

## **DIY Adaptation Kit**  

### **1. Extract the Essence**  
- *"What‚Äôs the irreducible core of this practice?"*  

### **2. Diagnose Your Needs**  
- Use the [Spiral Diagnostics Tool](/spiral-diagnostics.md)  

### **3. Remix Components**  
- Take:  
  - 20% native stage‚Äôs form  
  - 50% your stage‚Äôs language  
  - 30% next-stage stretch  

### **4. Stress-Test**  
- Try for 7 days, then ask:  
  - *"Did this deepen or dilute?"*  
  - *"Whose wisdom might I be misrepresenting?"*

## **Integration Milestones**  
**You‚Äôre adapting well when**:  
- Your practice feels *both* familiar and challenging  
- Teachers from its native stage would nod *and* frown slightly  
- *"I don‚Äôt change the teachings‚Äîthe teachings change me by how I meet them"*
