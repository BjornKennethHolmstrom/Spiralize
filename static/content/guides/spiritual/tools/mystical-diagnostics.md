# Spiral Diagnostics: Mystical Experience Edition

When you're feeling disoriented after a powerful mystical experience, this guide will help you locate which stage's gifts and challenges might be most relevant for integration.

## Quick Assessment

Ask yourself which of these resonates most with your experience:

| Stage | Experience Signature | Gift | Trap |
|-------|---------------------|------|------|
| **Beige** | Primal awe, direct sensory immersion | Raw presence, unfiltered aliveness | Mistaking instinct for insight |
| **Purple** | Ancestral presence, tribal connection | Intuitive knowing, mythic connection | Superstition over discernment |
| **Red** | Raw power, ecstatic energy | Unapologetic vitality | Spiritualized ego inflation |
| **Blue** | Divine law, structured revelation | Sacred discipline, moral clarity | Dogma stifling direct experience |
| **Orange** | Scientific awe, analytical insight | Curiosity, empirical testing | Reducing mysticism to brain chemistry |
| **Green** | Heart-opening, eco-mysticism | Empathic resonance, planetary love | "Love and light" bypassing shadow |
| **Yellow** | Meta-awareness, seeing patterns | Flexible frameworks, paradox humor | Overanalyzing the mystery |
| **Turquoise** | Non-dual unity, holographic perception | Embodied transcendence | Detached "oneness" avoiding earthly pain |
| **Coral** | Shadow alchemy, evolutionary play | Spontaneous wisdom, embodied divinity | Spiritual elitism ("I've transcended!") |
| **Ultra-Violet** | Radiant stillness, effortless presence | Effortless compassion, luminous awareness | Nihilism disguised as surrender |
| **Clear** | No experience, no experiencer | Absolute freedom, life flowing as itself | Noneâ€”existence is the practice |
