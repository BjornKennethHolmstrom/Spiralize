## Purpose

Feedback is a critical coaching tool, but its effectiveness depends on alignment with a leader’s stage-specific needs and sensitivities. This guide helps coaches:
- **Choose the Right Approach**: Select feedback styles (e.g., directive, collaborative) that match the leader’s stage (e.g., Red, Yellow).
- **Maximize Impact**: Deliver feedback that builds trust and encourages action.
- **Avoid Triggers**: Steer clear of approaches that cause conflict or stagnation (see [Triggers by Stage](#triggers-by-stage)).
- **Support Development**: Use feedback to guide leaders toward the next stage’s leadership style (see [Leadership Archetypes](#leadership-archetypes)).
