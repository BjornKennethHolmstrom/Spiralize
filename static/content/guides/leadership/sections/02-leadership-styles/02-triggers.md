# Triggers by Stage

This section outlines trigger points—disruptors that cause conflict or stagnation—for each Spiral Dynamics stage, helping coaches identify and navigate leadership challenges. By understanding these triggers, coaches can de-escalate tensions, foster resilience, and guide leaders toward growth.

---

## Purpose

Trigger points are sensitivities rooted in a leader’s stage-specific worldview that, when activated, lead to conflict, defensiveness, or stagnation. This guide enables coaches to:
- **Spot Triggers**: Recognize emotional or behavioral signs of a triggered leader (e.g., Red’s anger, Green’s withdrawal).
- **Mitigate Conflict**: Use stage-specific strategies to calm tensions and restore focus.
- **Support Growth**: Address triggers to unlock vertical development, aligning with the next stage’s worldview.
- **Enhance Team Dynamics**: Anticipate triggers in mixed-stage teams to improve collaboration.
