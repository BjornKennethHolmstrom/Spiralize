## Coaching Model Crosswalk: Spiral Leadership Meets GROW & ICF

### Why Crosswalks Matter

While Spiral Dynamics offers a **developmental lens**, most professional coaches and leadership consultants are trained in frameworks like **GROW** or **ICF Core Competencies**. This crosswalk helps integrate Spiral-based insight into familiar coaching paradigms‚Äî**bridging worldviews with practical structure**.

Use this section to:
- Translate leadership styles across Spiral stages into **GROW** conversations
- Align your coaching with **ICF competencies** in a stage-sensitive way
- Make Spiral Dynamics more accessible in professional coaching environments
