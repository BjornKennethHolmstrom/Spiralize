# Quick Start: Transition Checklist

This one-page guide provides a **Transition Checklist** to guide leaders through Spiral Dynamics stage shifts (e.g., Blue → Orange) and an initial **Progress Tracker** template to monitor early progress. Use it to navigate emotional phases, apply stage-specific tools, and measure growth.

## Transition Checklist

Follow these steps to support a leader through any Spiral Dynamics stage transition, from Beige to Coral. Each step integrates tools from Section IV and links to related resources.

1. **Identify the Stage and Transition**  
   - Use the [Spiral Stage Quiz](#spiral-stage-quiz) or [Spiral Cheat Sheet](#spiral-cheat-sheet) to determine the leader’s current stage (e.g., Orange) and next stage (e.g., Green).  
   - Review [Transition Maps](#transition-maps) to understand emotional phases (e.g., Denial, Exploration, Connection for Orange → Green).

2. **Assess Emotional Phase**  
   - Observe the leader’s emotions (e.g., frustration, curiosity) using [Transition Maps](#transition-maps) to pinpoint their phase (e.g., Resistance, Acceptance).  
   - Apply [Liminal Space Techniques](#liminal-space) like Somatic Grounding for overwhelm or Narrative Reframing for disillusionment.

3. **Apply Stage-Specific Motivation**  
   - Use [Motivational Styles](#motivational-styles) to inspire action (e.g., Results-Based Ambition for Orange, Connection-Based Collaboration for Green).  
   - Adapt to cultural norms (e.g., group-oriented for collectivist cultures) to ensure relevance.

4. **Implement Micro-Practices**  
   - Introduce [Markers of Transition](#markers-transition) like a Success Vision Board (Blue → Orange) or Team Connection Circle (Orange → Green) to mark progress.  
   - Frame practices neutrally (secular or spiritual) based on the leader’s context.

5. **Track Progress**  
   - Use the Progress Tracker (below) to record qualitative (e.g., language shifts) and quantitative (e.g., engagement frequency) indicators from [Evaluating Progress](#evaluating-progress).  
   - Review weekly to assess growth and adjust coaching strategies.

6. **Provide Feedback and Questions**  
   - Deliver stage-appropriate feedback (see [Feedback Strategies](#feedback-strategies)) to reinforce progress (e.g., structured for Blue, collaborative for Green).  
   - Ask stage-specific questions (see [Coaching Questions Table](#coaching-questions-table)) like “What does success look like for you?” (Orange) or “How can you foster connection?” (Green).

7. **Avoid Triggers**  
   - Check [Triggers by Stage](#triggers-by-stage) to prevent resistance (e.g., avoid challenging Blue’s values or Green’s need for consensus).  
   - Adapt for team dynamics if coaching groups (see [Team Dynamics](#team-dynamics)).

## Progress Tracker Template (Initial Use)

This simplified **Progress Tracker** helps coaches monitor early progress in a stage transition. Record one qualitative and one quantitative indicator weekly, noting observations. Download the full version for ongoing tracking.

**Download**: [Progress Tracker PDF](#progress-tracker-pdf) | [Progress Tracker CSV](#progress-tracker-csv)

| **Date** | **Stage** | **Qualitative Indicator** | **Quantitative Indicator** | **Notes** |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | e.g., Blue | e.g., Expressed curiosity about new strategies | e.g., Proposed 1 new idea | e.g., Hesitant but open to Orange |
| YYYY-MM-DD | e.g., Blue |                           |                            |           |

**Instructions**:
- **Select Stage**: Identify the leader’s current stage (e.g., Blue) using [Evaluating Progress](#evaluating-progress).
- **Record Indicators**: Note one qualitative (e.g., “Expressed ambition”) and one quantitative (e.g., “2 new ideas proposed”) indicator from the stage’s progress indicators.
- **Add Notes**: Document emotional phases (e.g., Exploration) or coaching insights.
- **Review**: Discuss with the leader to set next steps and adjust strategies.
