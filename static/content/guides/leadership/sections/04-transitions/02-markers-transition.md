# Markers of Transition

This section provides micro-practices to support leaders during Spiral Dynamics stage transitions (e.g., Blue → Orange), marking developmental shifts with intentional activities like journaling ceremonies or team vision quests. Framed neutrally for secular and spiritual users, these practices help leaders process emotions, build resilience, and integrate new worldviews.

---

## Purpose

Markers of Transition are brief, intentional practices that anchor leaders in the emotional and psychological phases of stage shifts (see [Transition Maps](#transition-maps)). They:
- **Honor the Journey**: Create space to reflect on and celebrate developmental growth.
- **Support Emotional Phases**: Address emotions like fear, curiosity, or clarity during transitions.
- **Bridge Stages**: Facilitate movement from one worldview to the next (e.g., Orange’s achievement to Green’s harmony).
- **Adapt to Context**: Offer neutral framing for diverse users, from corporate to spiritual settings.

Use these practices in coaching sessions, workshops, or team settings to mark transitions.

## How to Use Markers of Transition

1. **Identify the Transition**: Use the [Spiral Stage Quiz](#spiral-stage-quiz) or [Spiral Cheat Sheet](#spiral-cheat-sheet) to determine the leader’s stage and transition (see [Transition Maps](#transition-maps)).
2. **Select a Practice**: Choose the micro-practice matching the transition (e.g., Goal Collage for Blue → Orange).
3. **Adapt Framing**: Use secular or spiritual framing based on the leader’s context (e.g., corporate vs. retreat settings).
