# Evaluating Progress

This section provides qualitative and quantitative indicators to measure developmental progress during Spiral Dynamics stage transitions, along with a downloadable **Progress Tracker** template to monitor stage-specific behaviors over time. Use these tools to assess growth, identify stagnation, and guide leaders toward their next stage.

---

## Purpose

Evaluating Progress helps coaches track a leader’s developmental journey through Spiral Dynamics stages, ensuring coaching interventions are effective. This guide enables coaches to:
- **Measure Growth**: Use qualitative indicators (e.g., language shifts, emotional resilience) and quantitative metrics (e.g., team performance) to assess progress.
- **Identify Transitions**: Recognize signs of stage shifts (e.g., Blue’s increased flexibility signaling Orange).
- **Support Accountability**: Track behaviors with the Progress Tracker to maintain momentum.
- **Adapt to Context**: Apply indicators across individual and team settings, with cultural sensitivity.

Use these tools in coaching sessions, workshops, or team evaluations to monitor and support growth.

## Progress Indicators by Stage

Each stage includes qualitative and quantitative indicators to assess progress toward the next stage, aligned with emotional phases from [Transition Maps](#transition-maps). Indicators can be paired with stage-specific questions (see [Coaching Questions Table](#coaching-questions-table)) and feedback (see [Feedback Strategies](#feedback-strategies)).

## Progress Tracker Template

The **Progress Tracker** is a downloadable template to monitor stage-specific behaviors over time, helping coaches and leaders quantify growth. Use it to record qualitative and quantitative indicators weekly or monthly, adjusting based on coaching goals.

**Download**: [Progress Tracker PDF](#progress-tracker-pdf) | [Progress Tracker CSV](#progress-tracker-csv)

**Template**:

| **Date** | **Stage** | **Qualitative Indicator** | **Quantitative Indicator** | **Notes** |
|----------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Beige | e.g., Expressed trust in team | e.g., Attended 2 meetings | e.g., Less anxious, seeking connection |
| YYYY-MM-DD | Purple | e.g., Proposed new team ritual | e.g., Made 1 independent decision | e.g., Hesitant but assertive |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Instructions**:
1. **Select Stage**: Identify the leader’s current or transitioning stage using the [Spiral Stage Quiz](#spiral-stage-quiz) or [Spiral Cheat Sheet](#spiral-cheat-sheet).
2. **Record Indicators**: Note one qualitative (e.g., language shift) and one quantitative (e.g., frequency of behavior) indicator from the stage section above.
3. **Add Notes**: Document observations, emotional phases (see [Transition Maps](#transition-maps)), or coaching insights.
4. **Track Over Time**: Update weekly or monthly to visualize progress (e.g., increased engagement, reduced conflict).
5. **Review with Leader**: Share the tracker in sessions to discuss growth and set next steps.
