## International Coaching Federation (ICF) Competencies Crosswalk

This section maps common developmental coaching blind spots to the ICF Core Competencies (2021 update), helping you identify how developmental tendencies might enhance or hinder your effectiveness in each area.

### 1. Demonstrates Ethical Practice

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Over-coaching**: Imposing developmental frameworks without client consent | May violate client autonomy and informed consent principles | Clear contracting around developmental approach; client-led exploration of development |
| **Developmental arrogance**: Subtle judgment of "lower" stages | May create unethical power dynamics or lack of respect for client values | Developmental humility; genuine respect for all stages as valid expressions |
| **Projection**: Confusing client's development with coach's journey | May lead to inappropriate guidance or boundary violations | Clean distinction between personal development and client needs; appropriate self-disclosure |

**Integration Consideration**: How might you honor ICF ethical standards while incorporating developmental awareness? What additional ethical considerations arise in developmental coaching?

### 2. Embodies a Coaching Mindset

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Stage bias**: Preferring certain developmental expressions | May limit receptivity to client's authentic expression | Ongoing reflection on developmental biases; commitment to stage-appropriate coaching |
| **Developmental bypass**: Rushing through uncomfortable stages | May compromise coach's own development, limiting perspective | Commitment to integrating all developmental stages in one's practice |
| **Shadow avoidance**: Unwillingness to engage with developmental shadows | Limits coach's range and authenticity | Regular shadow work and developmental awareness practices |

**Integration Consideration**: How does your own developmental journey influence your coaching mindset? What practices support your continued evolution as a developmentally-aware coach?

### 3. Establishes and Maintains Agreements

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Mismatched complexity**: Using language beyond client's stage | Creates confusion and missed agreements | Stage-appropriate contracting language that meets client where they are |
| **Developmental agenda**: Bringing unstated developmental goals | May create hidden agendas that compromise clarity | Transparent discussion of developmental aspects when relevant |
| **Over-adaptation**: Collapsing completely into client's stage | May fail to create developmental stretch in agreements | Appropriate developmental challenge balanced with stage respect |

**Integration Consideration**: How might you create clear agreements that honor the client's developmental stage while creating appropriate conditions for growth?

### 4. Cultivates Trust and Safety

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Purple blind spot**: Undervaluing belonging and safety needs | May create psychological danger for clients with strong community values | Creating ritual, consistency, and tribal safety in the coaching container |
| **Blue blind spot**: Dismissing structure and clarity needs | May generate anxiety for clients who thrive with clear expectations | Providing appropriate structure and predictability for order-centered clients |
| **Green blind spot**: Minimizing relational and emotional safety | May bypass necessary trust-building with relationally-oriented clients | Demonstrating empathy and relationship focus with harmonydriven clients |

**Integration Consideration**: How does psychological safety look different at different developmental stages? How might you adapt your trust-building approach accordingly?

### 5. Maintains Presence

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Stage triggers**: Reactive responses to certain stage expressions | Compromises presence when clients express triggering perspectives | Developmental awareness of personal triggers; regulation practices |
| **Complexity bias**: Overthinking developmental patterns during coaching | Intellectual analysis rather than present-moment awareness | Balancing developmental awareness with present-moment attunement |
| **Developmental collapse**: Losing broader perspective in client's stage | Inability to hold developmental container when triggered | Maintaining developmental anchoring while demonstrating empathy |

**Integration Consideration**: How might you maintain both developmental awareness and moment-to-moment presence simultaneously? What helps you stay grounded when working with challenging stage expressions?

### 6. Listens Actively

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Selective listening**: Filtering for language matching preferred stages | Missing key information expressed through different stage perspectives | Multi-stage listening that recognizes value expressions across the spiral |
| **Developmental interpretation**: Over-interpreting through developmental lens | Imposing frameworks rather than receiving client's authentic meaning | Balancing developmental awareness with openness to client's unique expression |
| **Complex processing**: Getting lost in developmental analysis during listening | Compromised attention to client's immediate communication | Present-moment attention with light developmental awareness in background |

**Integration Consideration**: How might you listen for developmental patterns while staying fully receptive to the client's unique expression beyond any framework?

### 7. Evokes Awareness

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Over-coaching**: Pushing developmental insights before client readiness | Creating resistance or intellectual understanding without embodiment | Developmental pacing that respects client's integration capacity |
| **Under-coaching**: Avoiding developmental edges out of caution | Missed opportunities for transformative awareness | Appropriate developmental challenge within client's zone of proximal development |
| **Complexity matching**: Using awareness techniques too abstract/concrete for stage | Ineffective evocation due to mismatched complexity | Stage-appropriate inquiry that matches client's meaning-making capacity |

**Integration Consideration**: What awareness techniques are most effective at different developmental stages? How do you discern when to introduce developmental frameworks explicitly?

### 8. Facilitates Client Growth

| Developmental Blind Spot | Potential Impact | Developmental Strength |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Growth bias**: Overemphasis on vertical development over horizontal | Premature stage transitions without sufficient integration | Balanced attention to both vertical development and horizontal integration |
| **Action bias**: Pushing for behavior change without developmental readiness | Unsustainable changes that don't match developmental capacity | Developmental alignment of action plans with client's current capacity |
| **Developmental perfectionism**: Expecting ideal stage expression | Unrealistic expectations that create shame or inadequacy | Honoring messy, real-world development with compassion for limitations |

**Integration Consideration**: How do you define "growth" in developmental terms? How might this definition honor multiple forms of development beyond stage transitions?
