# Spiral-Aware Coach Self-Assessment

## Evaluating Your Developmental Coaching Capacities

This self-assessment helps you evaluate your strengths and growth areas as a spiral-aware coach. By honestly reflecting on your tendencies, biases, and capacities across developmental stages, you'll gain insight into how to enhance your effectiveness with diverse clients.

This assessment covers four key dimensions:
1. **Stage Fluency**: Your ability to understand and communicate effectively with each stage
2. **Developmental Awareness**: Your capacity to recognize and work with developmental patterns
3. **Coaching Balance**: Your tendencies toward over-coaching or under-coaching
4. **Personal Development**: Your own developmental journey and its impact on your coaching

Complete each section, noting patterns that emerge. This assessment is designed for your personal growth, not as a certification or evaluation tool. The goal is self-awareness, not achieving a perfect score.

## Scoring and Interpretation

### Stage Fluency Profile
Plot your scores for each stage to create your Stage Fluency Profile:

```
25 |
   |
20 |
   |
15 |
   |
10 |
   |
 5 |
   |
 0 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
     Be  Pu  Re  Bl  Or  Gr  Ye  Tu  Co
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Balanced Profile** (similar scores across stages): Indicates broad developmental range
- **Ascending Profile** (higher scores at "later" stages): May indicate developmental bias
- **Descending Profile** (higher scores at "earlier" stages): May indicate developmental comfort zone
- **Valley Profile** (lower scores in middle): May indicate developmental leapfrogging
- **Peak Profile** (higher scores in middle): May indicate developmental transition focus

### Overall Assessment
