# Coaching Questions: Purple Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Purple stage is tribal and tradition-bound, driven by belonging, rituals, and community. Purple clients value group identity, shared customs, and loyalty to their “tribe” (family, team, or culture). They see life as a circle of connection, where safety and meaning come from collective bonds and ancestral wisdom.

- **Core Need**: Belonging and tradition.
- **Typical Language**: “We stick together.” “This is our way.” “Honor the past.”
- **Example Persona**: Maria, a community leader who cherishes cultural rituals and group unity.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Purple’s focus on belonging and resonate with their worldview:

- What traditions or rituals make you feel connected?
- How can you strengthen your bond with your group?
- What shared story or value inspires you right now?
- Who in your community supports you the most?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Red’s focus on personal power and autonomy:

- What strength could you bring to your group as a leader?
- How might you express your own voice within the community?
- When has trying something new helped your group grow?
- What would it feel like to take a bold step while staying connected?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Purple’s worldview:

- Why not just do what’s best for you? (Red-focused, feels selfish.)
- What’s the most efficient way to do this? (Orange-focused, feels impersonal.)
- Why stick to old traditions? (Yellow-focused, feels disrespectful.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Purple clients may focus on personal ties to a small group. Use questions like “What group makes you feel at home?” to connect.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Emphasize communal traditions and loyalty. Example: “How can you honor your family’s customs?” or “What ritual strengthens your community?”
- **Traditional Settings**: Highlight rituals (e.g., “What ceremony brings your group together?”).
- **Modern Settings**: Frame belonging in terms of team culture (e.g., “What shared value unites your team?”).

## Client Communication Template

Use this script to explain the Purple stage to clients in simple, empathetic language:

> “You have a deep connection to your community and traditions, which creates a strong sense of belonging. You thrive when you’re part of a group that shares values and rituals. In our coaching, we’ll celebrate those bonds to keep you grounded. We’ll also explore ways to express your unique strengths, so you can grow while staying connected.”

- **Delivery Tips**:
  - Honor their loyalty (e.g., “Your commitment to your group is powerful”).
  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s find a way to share your voice in the group”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Purple stage”; use terms like “your sense of belonging.”
- **Follow-Up**: Ask a Core Question (e.g., “What traditions or rituals make you feel connected?”) to start the session.
