# Coaching Questions by Stage: Overview

## Purpose
This section equips coaches with stage-specific questions to unlock client growth and avoid missteps that stall progress. Tailored to each Spiral Dynamics stage, these questions resonate with a client’s worldview, encourage vertical development, and navigate resistance empathetically.

## How It Works
Each stage (Beige to Turquoise) has a unique set of needs and motivations. By asking the right questions, you can:
- **Connect Deeply**: Align with the client’s current stage to build trust.
- **Spark Growth**: Nudge clients toward the next stage with growth-oriented prompts.
- **Avoid Triggers**: Steer clear of questions that cause defensiveness or disconnection.

## Components
For each stage, you’ll find:
- **Worldview Summary**: The stage’s core motivations and perspective.
- **Core Questions**: Prompts to engage the client’s current stage.
- **Growth Edge Questions**: Prompts to encourage vertical development to the next stage.
- **Misstep Questions**: Questions to avoid that may trigger resistance.
- **Cultural Notes**: Tips for adapting questions to cultural or organizational contexts (e.g., collectivist vs. individualist cultures).
- **Client Communication Template**: A script to explain the stage to clients in simple, non-technical language.
