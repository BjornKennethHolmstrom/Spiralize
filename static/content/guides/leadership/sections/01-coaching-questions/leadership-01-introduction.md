## Spiral Cheat Sheet

The **Spiral Cheat Sheet** is a quick-reference guide to Spiral Dynamics stages, summarizing each stageâ€™s worldview, values, and key characteristics. Use it to identify a leaderâ€™s stage, understand their motivations, or explain the model to clients.

|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|

**How to Use**:
1. **Identify Stage**: Match a leaderâ€™s behaviors or values to the stageâ€™s characteristics (e.g., focus on success = Orange).
2. **Understand Motivations**: Use Core Values to tailor coaching (e.g., empathy for Green, systems for Yellow).
3. **Guide Transitions**: Reference Leadership Style and Triggers to support stage shifts (see [Transition Maps](#transition-maps)).
4. **Explain to Clients**: Share the PDF or table to introduce Spiral Dynamics in sessions.

**Coaching Tip**: Pair with the [Spiral Stage Quiz](#spiral-stage-quiz) for a deeper assessment or [Coaching Questions Table](#coaching-questions-table) for stage-specific prompts.

**Cultural Note**: In collectivist cultures, emphasize group-oriented values (e.g., Purpleâ€™s belonging, Greenâ€™s harmony); in individualist cultures, highlight personal agency (e.g., Redâ€™s autonomy, Orangeâ€™s success).
