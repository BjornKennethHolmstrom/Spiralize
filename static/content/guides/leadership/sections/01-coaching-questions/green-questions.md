# Coaching Questions: Green Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Green stage is community-focused, driven by equality, collaboration, and empathy. Green clients value harmony, inclusivity, and shared purpose, often prioritizing relationships over individual achievement. They see life as a collective journey, where everyone’s voice matters.

- **Core Need**: Harmony and equality.
- **Typical Language**: “We need to connect.” “Everyone should have a say.” “Let’s make it fair.”
- **Example Persona**: Emma, a nonprofit organizer who champions team unity and social impact.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Green’s focus on collaboration and resonate with their worldview:

- How can you foster connection in this situation?
- What would make everyone feel heard and valued?
- What shared purpose inspires you or your team?
- How can you create a more inclusive approach?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Yellow’s focus on systems-thinking and flexibility:

- How can you make a tough decision while honoring your values?
- What bigger system could your efforts influence?
- When has focusing on harmony slowed progress?
- How can you balance inclusivity with clear priorities?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Green’s worldview:

- Why don’t you just focus on winning? (Orange-focused, feels competitive.)
- What’s the one right way to do this? (Blue-focused, feels rigid.)
- Why care about others’ feelings? (Red-focused, feels dismissive.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Green clients may focus on personal empathy. Use questions like “How can you create fairness?” to resonate.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Emphasize group harmony and communal goals. Example: “How can your team work as one?” or “What strengthens your community’s bond?”
- **Corporate Settings**: Frame questions around team culture (e.g., “How can inclusivity boost team performance?”).
- **Community Settings**: Tie questions to collective impact (e.g., “How can your group’s unity drive change?”).

## Client Communication Template

Use this script to explain the Green stage to clients in simple, empathetic language:

> “You have a natural gift for building connection and ensuring everyone feels valued, which creates strong teams and communities. You thrive on collaboration and fairness. In our coaching, we’ll lean into those strengths to deepen your impact. We’ll also explore ways to balance inclusivity with making clear decisions, so you can grow with confidence.”

- **Delivery Tips**:
  - Celebrate their empathy (e.g., “Your ability to bring people together is inspiring”).
  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s look at how to make decisions without losing connection”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Green stage”; use terms like “your focus on collaboration.”
- **Follow-Up**: Ask a Core Question (e.g., “How can you foster connection in this situation?”) to start the session.

## Key Takeaways

- Green clients thrive on harmony—use Core Questions to engage their collaborative spirit.
