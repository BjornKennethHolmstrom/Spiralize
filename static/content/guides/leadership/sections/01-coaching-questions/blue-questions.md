# Coaching Questions: Blue Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Blue stage is orderly and rule-based, driven by structure, duty, and long-term stability. Blue clients value clear roles, moral codes, and doing what’s right according to established guidelines. They see life as a system of responsibilities, where following rules ensures fairness and security.

- **Core Need**: Order and duty.
- **Typical Language**: “What’s the right thing to do?” “We need structure.” “Rules are there for a reason.”
- **Example Persona**: David, an operations manager who prioritizes company policies and ethical standards.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Blue’s focus on structure and resonate with their worldview:

- What rules or values guide your decisions in this situation?
- How can you honor your sense of duty while addressing this challenge?
- What structure would help you feel secure and effective?
- Who or what defines what’s right for you right now?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Orange’s focus on innovation and efficiency:

- When have rules held you back from finding a better way?
- What would happen if you experimented with a new approach?
- How could a small change improve results without losing stability?
- What does progress look like within your values?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Blue’s worldview:

- Why don’t you just break the rules to get ahead? (Orange-focused, feels reckless.)
- What’s best for the team’s feelings? (Green-focused, feels irrelevant.)
- Why care about structure when things are chaotic? (Red-focused, feels destabilizing.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Blue clients may emphasize personal duty to principles. Use questions like “What’s the right thing for you to do?” to connect.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Frame duty in terms of group loyalty. Example: “How can you uphold your team’s traditions?” or “What rules strengthen your community?”
- **Corporate Settings**: Link questions to organizational policies (e.g., “How do company guidelines support your goals?”).
- **Faith-Based Settings**: Tie questions to moral or spiritual frameworks (e.g., “How do your beliefs guide your next step?”).

## Client Communication Template

Use this script to explain the Blue stage to clients in simple, empathetic language:

> “You have a strong sense of duty and value doing what’s right, which brings stability and trust to your work. You thrive when there’s clear structure and guidelines. In our coaching, we’ll honor those strengths to help you feel secure. We’ll also explore small ways to adapt or innovate, so you can grow while staying true to your values.”

- **Delivery Tips**:
  - Acknowledge their commitment to integrity (e.g., “I admire how you stick to what’s right”).
  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s try a small experiment that fits your principles”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Blue stage”; use terms like “your focus on structure.”
- **Follow-Up**: Ask a Core Question (e.g., “What rules or values guide your decisions?”) to start the session.
