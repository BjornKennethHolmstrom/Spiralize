# Coaching Questions: Turquoise Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Turquoise stage is holistic and global, driven by interconnected systems and collective well-being. Turquoise clients value aligning personal and planetary goals, seeing life as a unified web where every action impacts the whole. They prioritize balance, deep purpose, and fostering harmony across ecosystems, often with a spiritual or universal perspective.

- **Core Need**: Holistic balance and collective well-being.
- **Typical Language**: “It’s all connected.” “What serves the greater good?” “How do we align with the planet?”
- **Example Persona**: Liam, a sustainability leader who integrates global systems for environmental and social impact.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Turquoise’s focus on holistic systems and resonate with their worldview:

- How does this decision impact the broader system or planet?
- What deeper purpose connects your actions to the collective good?
- How can you foster balance across all parts of this situation?
- What universal truth or value guides you right now?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Coral’s focus on existential purpose and transcendent integration:

- What lies beyond this system that you could explore?
- How can you transcend current limits to find a deeper truth?
- When have you felt called to let go of a system for something greater?
- What would it mean to act from a place of pure presence or essence?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Turquoise’s worldview:

- How can you optimize this for efficiency? (Orange-focused, feels narrow.)
- Why not stick to one right way? (Blue-focused, feels rigid.)
- What’s best for your personal success? (Red-focused, feels disconnected.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Turquoise clients may emphasize personal alignment with universal values. Use questions like “What deeper purpose guides you?” to connect.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Frame balance in terms of communal or global harmony. Example: “How can your community align with planetary well-being?” or “What connects your group to the greater whole?”
- **Corporate Settings**: Link questions to organizational sustainability (e.g., “How can your company balance profit and planetary impact?”).
- **Spiritual Settings**: Emphasize universal or spiritual connections (e.g., “What cosmic principle guides your actions?”).

## Client Communication Template

Use this script to explain the Turquoise stage to clients in simple, empathetic language:

> “You have a profound ability to see life as a connected whole, guiding your actions toward the greater good. You thrive on creating balance and purpose across systems, from personal to planetary. In our coaching, we’ll honor that vision to deepen your impact. We’ll also explore ways to connect with even deeper truths, so your work feels transcendent and fulfilling.”

- **Delivery Tips**:
  - Celebrate their vision (e.g., “Your ability to see the big picture is inspiring”).
  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s explore what lies beyond these systems”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Turquoise stage”; use terms like “your holistic vision.”
- **Follow-Up**: Ask a Core Question (e.g., “How does this decision impact the broader system or planet?”) to start the session.
