# Coaching Questions: Orange Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Orange stage is achievement-oriented, driven by goals, innovation, and personal success. Orange clients value measurable results, efficiency, and standing out. They see life as a game to win through strategy and competence, often prioritizing individual accomplishment over collective needs.

- **Core Need**: Success and progress.
- **Typical Language**: “I want results,” “What’s the payoff?” “How do I get ahead?”
- **Example Persona**: Alex, a sales manager focused on hitting targets and earning promotions.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Orange’s focus on achievement and resonate with their worldview:

- What does success look like for you in this situation?
- How will you measure progress toward your goal?
- What’s one bold move you can make to stand out?
- What resources can you leverage to get results faster?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Green’s focus on community and shared purpose:

- Whose values are you optimizing for in this goal?
- What might success cost you or others in the long run?
- When have you felt fulfilled without chasing a win?
- How could your success benefit your team or community?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Orange’s worldview:

- Why don’t you focus on team harmony? (Green-focused, feels soft.)
- What’s the moral duty here? (Blue-focused, feels restrictive.)
- How can you sacrifice your goals for the group? (Collectivist, feels demotivating.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Orange clients often thrive on personal achievement. Emphasize questions like “How will you stand out?” to resonate.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Frame success in group terms to align with cultural values. Example: “How can your team lead the market?” or “What results will make your community proud?”
- **Corporate Settings**: Tie questions to organizational metrics (e.g., “How will this goal boost company revenue?”).
- **Nonprofit Settings**: Link success to mission impact (e.g., “How will this result advance our cause?”).

  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s look at how your wins can lift others too”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Orange stage”; use terms like “your focus on achievement.”
