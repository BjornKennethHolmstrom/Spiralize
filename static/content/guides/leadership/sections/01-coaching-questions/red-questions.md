# Coaching Questions: Red Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Red stage is power-driven, focused on control, respect, and immediate results. Red clients value strength, autonomy, and asserting their will, often acting impulsively to achieve their desires. They see life as a battle where the strongest prevail, prioritizing personal dominance over rules or collaboration.

- **Core Need**: Power and respect.
- **Typical Language**: “I want control.” “Respect me.” “Let’s do this now.”
- **Example Persona**: Jamal, a startup founder who thrives on bold moves and commanding attention.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Red’s focus on power and resonate with their worldview:

- What would make you feel in control of this situation?
- How can you earn the respect you deserve?
- What bold action feels right to you right now?
- Who or what is standing in your way, and how can you overcome it?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Blue’s focus on structure and duty:

- What would it mean to gain respect through consistent rules?
- How could a plan make your actions even stronger?
- When has slowing down led to a bigger win?
- What legacy do you want to build beyond this moment?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Red’s worldview:

- Why don’t you follow the group’s rules? (Blue-focused, feels restrictive.)
- How can you make everyone feel included? (Green-focused, feels weak.)
- What’s the long-term strategy here? (Orange-focused, feels abstract.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Red clients often emphasize personal dominance. Use questions like “How can you stand out?” to connect.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Frame power in terms of group leadership. Example: “How can you lead your team to victory?” or “What strength can you bring to your community?”
- **High-Conflict Settings**: Align questions with their need for control (e.g., “How can you take charge of this challenge?”).
- **Team Settings**: Focus on respect within the group (e.g., “How can your strength inspire your team?”).

## Client Communication Template

Use this script to explain the Red stage to clients in simple, empathetic language:

> “You have a natural drive for strength and respect, which makes you a powerful force. You thrive on taking charge and getting results fast. In our coaching, we’ll channel that energy to help you achieve what matters most. We’ll also explore ways to build lasting impact, so your strength creates something even bigger.”

- **Delivery Tips**:
  - Acknowledge their boldness (e.g., “I see how you take charge with confidence”).
  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s look at how a plan can amplify your impact”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Red stage”; use terms like “your drive for control.”
- **Follow-Up**: Ask a Core Question (e.g., “What would make you feel in control of this situation?”) to start the session.

## Key Takeaways

- Red clients thrive on power—use Core Questions to engage their need for control.
