# Coaching Questions: Beige Stage

## Worldview Summary

The Beige stage is survival-driven, focused on meeting basic physiological needs like food, safety, and shelter. Beige clients prioritize immediate security and physical well-being, often operating in a reactive mode with limited awareness of broader systems or relationships. They see life as a struggle to stay alive, driven by instinct and necessity.

- **Core Need**: Survival and safety.
- **Typical Language**: “I need food.” “I’m not safe.” “I just want to rest.”
- **Example Persona**: Sarah, a client in crisis, focused on securing housing and basic resources.

## Core Questions

These questions align with Beige’s focus on survival and resonate with their worldview:

- What do you need right now to feel safe and secure?
- How can you get the rest or resources you need today?
- What’s one step you can take to meet your basic needs?
- Where can you find a safe space to regroup?

## Growth Edge Questions

These prompts encourage movement toward Purple’s focus on belonging and community:

- Who might help you feel supported or safe?
- What would it feel like to connect with others once your needs are met?
- How could a small group or ritual bring you comfort?
- What strength could you share with others when you’re ready?

## Misstep Questions

Avoid these questions, as they may trigger resistance or feel irrelevant to Beige’s worldview:

- What’s your long-term plan? (Orange-focused, feels abstract.)
- How can you follow the rules? (Blue-focused, feels irrelevant.)
- Why not focus on team harmony? (Green-focused, feels overwhelming.)

## Cultural Notes

- **Individualist Cultures**: Beige clients may focus on personal survival. Use questions like “What do you need to feel safe?” to connect.
- **Collectivist Cultures**: Frame safety in terms of family or community support. Example: “Who in your family can help you feel secure?” or “What group can offer you shelter?”
- **Crisis Settings**: Prioritize immediate needs (e.g., “What resource can you access now?”).
- **Stable Settings**: Gently introduce community (e.g., “Who could you turn to for support?”).

## Client Communication Template

Use this script to explain the Beige stage to clients in simple, empathetic language:

> “Right now, you’re focused on staying safe and meeting your basic needs, which is a natural and important priority. You’re doing what it takes to survive, and that’s a real strength. In our coaching, we’ll make sure you have the support you need to feel secure. When you’re ready, we’ll explore ways to connect with others for even more stability.”

- **Delivery Tips**:
  - Validate their struggle (e.g., “I see how hard you’re working to stay safe”).
  - Introduce growth edges gently (e.g., “Let’s find one person who can support you”).
  - Avoid jargon like “Beige stage”; use terms like “your focus on safety.”
- **Follow-Up**: Ask a Core Question (e.g., “What do you need right now to feel safe and secure?”) to start the session.
