# Orange Stage: Example Exercise and Case Study

## Working with the Achievement-Driven Shadow

The Orange stage brings gifts of innovation, strategic thinking, and results-orientation. However, its shadow often manifests as over-identification with achievement, status-seeking, and a relentless drive that can lead to burnout and disconnection from deeper values. This section provides a practical role-play exercise and case study for working with Orange-stage shadows.

## Example Exercise: Dialoguing with the "Success-Driven Self"

### Purpose
This role-play exercise helps clients externalize and examine their achievement-driven aspects, uncovering both the protective functions and limitations of this pattern.

### Setup
- **Format**: One-on-one coaching session (45-60 minutes)
- **Materials**: Journal for client notes, two chairs (for in-person sessions)
- **Preparation**: Brief explanation of voice dialogue method and normalizing the achievement drive

### Role-Play Script

#### Introduction (5 minutes)

**Coach**: "Today we'll explore the part of you that's focused on achievement and success. Many of us have this 'success-driven self' that helps us accomplish goals but can sometimes take over. This exercise helps us understand this aspect better without judging it. Are you open to getting curious about this part of yourself?"

**Setup Context**: "Think of a recent situation where you felt driven to succeed, perhaps working late, competing for recognition, or pushing to meet a goal at all costs."

#### Voice Dialogue Process (20-30 minutes)

**Coach**: "I'd like you to imagine your success-driven self as a distinct character or part of you. It might have a name, an appearance, or a feeling associated with it. Take a moment to sense this part."

[Allow client time to connect with this aspect]

**Coach**: "Now, I'm going to speak directly to this success-driven part of you. You might be surprised by what emerges, so stay curious."

[For in-person sessions, you may invite the client to change chairs to embody this part]

**Key Dialogue Questions**:

1. "Hello, Success-Driven Self. What's your role in [client's name]'s life?"
2. "When did you first become important in their life?"
3. "What are you afraid would happen if you weren't in charge?"
4. "What do you need to feel safe enough to relax sometimes?"
5. "What do you want [client's name] to understand about you?"
6. "What gifts do you bring that you want acknowledged?"
7. "What price has [client's name] paid for listening to you exclusively?"
8. "How would you feel about collaborating with other parts rather than always being in control?"

**Transition Back**: "Thank this part for sharing, and now return your awareness to your whole self, noticing what insights emerged."

#### Reflection and Integration (10-15 minutes)

**Coach**: "Speaking as yourself now, what was most surprising about what your success-driven self expressed?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. "What needs is this part trying to meet through achievement?"
2. "How does this part protect you? What does it fear?"
3. "Where might this pattern have originated in your history?"
4. "What would a healthier relationship with this part look like?"
5. "What other aspects of yourself might need more expression to balance this drive?"

### Journal Follow-Up Assignment

Provide the client with these journaling prompts to continue integration between sessions:

**Prompt Set One: Understanding the Pattern**
- When I think about my success-driven self, the physical sensations I notice are...
- This part of me believes that without achievement, I would be...
- The unspoken rules this part lives by include...
- When I look at my history, this pattern started or intensified when...

**Prompt Set Two: Integration Steps**
- One way I could honor my success-driven self while not letting it dominate is...
- Values I want to prioritize alongside achievement include...
- A practice that might help me recognize when this part takes over is...
- A more balanced definition of success for me might look like...

### Variations for Different Contexts

**For Group Settings**:
- Have participants pair up, taking turns being the coach and client
- Provide written reflection time after partner exercises
- Facilitate group sharing about patterns noticed across participants

**For Virtual Settings**:
- Use visualization rather than physical chair switching
- Invite clients to change posture or facial expression to embody the success-driven self
- Use screen sharing to record key insights in real time

## Case Study: Jonathan's Integration Journey

### Client Background
Jonathan, 42, was a senior manager at a tech company who sought coaching for burnout and relationship difficulties. He displayed classic Orange-stage characteristics:

- Driven to achieve measurable results and recognition
- Identity strongly tied to professional accomplishments
- Difficulty being present with family despite valuing them in theory
- Physical symptoms including insomnia and digestive issues
- Beginning awareness that "something is missing" despite external success

### Initial Assessment

In early sessions, Jonathan's language revealed his Orange center of gravity:
- "I need to optimize my personal life like I do my work projects"
- "I'm falling behind competitors in my industry"
- "I just need more efficient systems to balance everything"

Shadow patterns included:
- Treating relationships as transactions or achievements
- Dismissing emotional concerns as "inefficient"
- Constant comparison to peers and industry benchmarks
- Difficulty experiencing satisfaction with accomplishments

### The Voice Dialogue Session

After establishing trust over several sessions, the coach introduced the voice dialogue exercise to explore Jonathan's achievement-driven self.

**Key Moments and Breakthroughs**:

**Coach**: "What's your role in Jonathan's life?"

**Achievement Self**: "I make sure he succeeds. I push him when he'd rather be lazy. Without me, he'd be nothing—just like his father who never lived up to his potential."

This revealed a generational pattern and core fear previously unacknowledged.

**Coach**: "What are you afraid would happen if you weren't in charge?"

**Achievement Self**: "He'd fail. Everyone would see he's not actually special or talented. The success is because I'm driving him—if I let up, it all falls apart."

This uncovered impostor syndrome beneath the confident exterior.

**Coach**: "What do you need to feel safe enough to relax sometimes?"

**Achievement Self**: "I need to know there's a backup plan. And honestly, I need proof that people would still value him if he wasn't producing and achieving all the time."

This revealed a core wound around conditional love and acceptance.

**Coach**: "What price has Jonathan paid for listening to you exclusively?"

**Achievement Self**: [long pause] "He's missed his kids growing up. He doesn't even know who he is outside of work. His body is breaking down. Sometimes I wonder if I'm protecting him or killing him."

This moment of self-awareness created visible emotion and a shift in energy.

### Integration Process

Following the dialogue exercise, Jonathan's integration journey included:

**Immediate Insights**:
- Recognition that his achievement drive originated from watching his father's career disappointments
- Awareness of using work success to avoid intimacy and vulnerability
- Understanding that his physical symptoms were signals from neglected aspects of self

**Integration Practices**:
1. Daily journaling to track when the achievement drive activated and what triggered it
2. Somatic practice to recognize bodily sensations associated with the pattern
3. Scheduled "non-productive" time with family where outcomes weren't measured
4. Meditation focused on self-worth separate from accomplishments
5. Regular check-ins with achievement self, acknowledging its protective intent

**Growth Edge Work**:
- Exploring Green-stage values around connection and meaning
- Developing capacity to be present without agenda or goal
- Building identity aspects not tied to professional achievement

### Results After Six Months

Jonathan reported significant shifts:
- Reduced physical symptoms, particularly improved sleep
- More authentic conversations with spouse about needs and fears
- Ability to notice achievement drive activation without being controlled by it
- Beginning to derive satisfaction from presence and connection, not just results
- Developing language for emotions previously labeled as "inefficient"

**Critical Moment**: When passed over for a promotion, Jonathan was able to process disappointment without identity collapse—evidence of reduced over-identification with achievement.

### Coach's Reflections

Working with Jonathan highlighted typical patterns in Orange-stage shadow work:
- The achievement drive often masks deeper fears about inherent worth
- Somatic symptoms frequently signal the cost of over-identification
- Integration doesn't mean abandoning ambition but relating to it differently
- The transition toward Green-stage values requires mourning certain Orange-stage payoffs
- Shadow work at this stage creates space for asking "what is success for?" rather than just "how do I succeed?"

### Application for Similar Clients

This case demonstrates effective approaches for clients with Orange-stage shadow patterns:
- Use achievement-oriented language initially to build rapport
- Frame shadow work in terms of "optimization" and "effectiveness"
- Connect physical symptoms to achievement patterns explicitly
- Provide evidence-based practices that appeal to Orange's rational mindset
- Honor the gifts of the achievement drive while expanding identity beyond it
