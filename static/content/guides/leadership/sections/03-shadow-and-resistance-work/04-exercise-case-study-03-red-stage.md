# Red Stage: Example Exercise and Case Study

## Working with the Power-Driven Shadow

The Red stage brings gifts of assertiveness, action-orientation, ability to protect boundaries, and instinctive leadership. However, its shadow often manifests as impulsivity, domination, aggression when threatened, and an inability to consider long-term consequences. This section provides a practical exercise and case study for working with Red-stage shadows.

## Example Exercise: "Power Redirection" Physical Practice

### Purpose
This physical movement exercise helps clients redirect power impulses constructively, addressing the Red-stage shadow tendency toward impulsive reactivity and dominance without suppressing vital energy.

### Setup
- **Format**: One-on-one coaching session (40-50 minutes)
- **Materials**: Open space for movement, optional props like pillows or stress balls
- **Preparation**: Brief discussion on the distinction between power and domination

### Power Redirection Exercise Script

#### Introduction (5 minutes)

**Coach**: "Today we'll explore what I call 'Power Redirection'—a practice that honors your natural strength and assertiveness while developing greater choice in how you express it. Your ability to take action, set boundaries, and protect what matters is a vital strength. This exercise helps channel that power constructively rather than suppressing it or letting it control you. Are you open to exploring this through some physical movement?"

**Setup Context**: "Think of a recent situation where you felt your power impulse activated—perhaps when you felt challenged, disrespected, or needed to assert a boundary. We'll use that scenario to work with your energy physically."

#### Physical Power Practices (25-30 minutes)

**Coach**: "We'll explore three different ways of working with power energy, spending about 8-10 minutes with each approach. I'll guide you with prompts, and we'll reflect briefly between each practice."

1. **Recognizing Power Impulses**

**Coach**: "Stand in a comfortable position and bring to mind that situation where your power impulse was activated. Allow yourself to feel the physical sensations that arise—perhaps heat, tension, energy in your chest or arms. Don't act on them yet, just notice where and how this power shows up in your body."

[Guide client for 3-4 minutes of awareness]

**Coach**: "Now, while staying aware of these sensations, allow your body to express this power energy in whatever way feels natural—it might be a gesture, stance, or movement. Let the power move through you without censoring it."

[Allow client 4-5 minutes to express this energy]

**Reflection Questions**:
- "Where in your body did you first notice the power energy arising?"
- "What was your natural impulse for expressing this energy?"
- "What thoughts or emotions accompanied this physical impulse?"
- "How does this power energy feel when you allow it expression without judgment?"

2. **Containing Without Suppressing**

**Coach**: "Now we'll work with containing this power energy without suppressing it. Imagine this energy is like water—it needs a channel to flow effectively rather than being dammed up or flooding everywhere."

**Coach**: "Again, connect with that power sensation in your body. This time, as you feel it arise, consciously direct it down through your core, into your legs, and into the ground—like roots anchoring a strong tree. Feel the stability this creates."

[Guide client for 3-4 minutes]

**Coach**: "Now experiment with moving from this grounded power. How might you express boundary-setting or assertiveness while staying connected to this earth energy? Find movements that feel both powerful AND contained."

[Allow client 4-5 minutes for this exploration]

**Reflection Questions**:
- "How does grounded power feel different from reactive power?"
- "What changes in your thinking when your power is channeled through your core and legs?"
- "What new options for expression become available with this containment?"
- "How might this grounded power serve situations where reactive power creates problems?"

3. **Redirecting for Creative Purpose**

**Coach**: "For this final practice, we'll explore how your power energy can be redirected toward creative or protective purposes rather than dominance."

**Coach**: "Once more, connect with that power sensation. This time, imagine this energy as a resource you can direct intentionally. What worthy challenge or creative goal could benefit from this power? As you identify that purpose, allow your movements to express power in service of building or protecting something meaningful."

[Guide client for 8-10 minutes in this exploration]

**Reflection Questions**:
- "How does purposeful power feel different from reactive power?"
- "What becomes possible when you direct this energy intentionally?"
- "What worthy purposes in your life could benefit from this channeled strength?"
- "How might others respond differently to this form of power expression?"

#### Integration Dialogue (10-15 minutes)

**Coach**: "Let's reflect on what you discovered through these different ways of working with power. What key insights are you taking away?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. "What distinction did you notice between power itself and how it's expressed?"
2. "How might you recognize your power impulses earlier, before they become reactive?"
3. "What physical practices could help you channel this energy constructively in daily life?"
4. "What worthy purposes could your power serve when directed intentionally?"

### Journal Follow-Up Assignment

Provide the client with these journaling prompts to continue integration between sessions:

**Prompt Set One: Power Awareness**
- Situations that consistently trigger my reactive power impulses include...
- Physical signs that my power energy is activating include...
- My typical reactive expressions of power look like...
- The impact these reactive expressions have on others and my goals is...

- Three worthy purposes my power energy could serve include...
- Physical practices that help me ground and channel power include...
- What becomes possible when I direct my power intentionally is...
- One situation this week where I could practice redirecting power is...

### Variations for Different Contexts

**For Group Settings**:
- Use partner exercises where participants practice sensing and expressing power with awareness
- Create movement circles where each person demonstrates their grounded power expression
- Use role-play scenarios to practice redirecting power in challenging situations

**For Virtual Settings**:
- Focus on upper body movements visible on camera
- Use objects at home (pillows, stress balls) for physical power expression
- Create visualization components that can be done seated

## Case Study: Marcus's Integration Journey

### Client Background
Marcus, 34, was a startup founder who sought coaching to address conflicts with his team and investors. His leadership style was creating unnecessary tension despite his vision and drive. He displayed characteristic Red-stage patterns:

- Strong assertive energy and natural leadership presence
- Quick decision-making and action-orientation
- Difficulty controlling emotional reactions when challenged
- Tendency to dominate meetings and override others' input
- Impulsive actions that sometimes created long-term problems
- Growing awareness that his leadership approach was limiting company growth

### Initial Assessment

In early sessions, Marcus's language revealed his Red center of gravity:
- "I don't have time for consensus—someone needs to make decisions"
- "When people challenge me, I need to show strength or lose respect"
- "If I don't push hard, nothing gets done around here"
- "Either you're in control or being controlled—that's just reality"

Shadow patterns included:
- Impulsive reactions when feeling disrespected
- Difficulty considering long-term consequences of actions
- Using intimidation rather than influence
- Viewing vulnerability as weakness to be hidden

### The Power Redirection Session

After establishing trust by respecting Marcus's leadership drive and acknowledging his strengths, the coach introduced the "Power Redirection" physical practice to help him develop more choice in expressing his natural assertiveness.

**Key Moments and Breakthroughs**:

**From the Recognizing Power Impulses practice**:

**Marcus**: [after physical expression that involved punching motions and strong gestures] "I felt the energy first in my chest, like heat spreading up through my shoulders. My natural impulse was to push forward, take up more space. It's interesting—there's almost a rush to it, like I'm more alive when I feel this power surge."

**Coach**: "What thoughts or emotions accompanied this physical impulse?"

**Marcus**: "Thoughts like 'I'll show them' or 'They can't push me around.' There's anger, but also something else—maybe excitement? And beneath that... I'm noticing some fear that if I don't dominate, I'll be dominated."

This revealed both the energizing aspect of his power expression and the underlying fear driving its reactive form.

**From the Containing Without Suppressing practice**:

**Marcus**: [after grounding exercises, his movements became more deliberate and centered] "This feels... different. Still strong, but less frantic. When I send the energy down into my legs and feet, my thinking slows down. I'm still feeling powerful, but it's like I have a moment to choose what to do with that power."

**Coach**: "What changes in your thinking when your power is channeled through your core and legs?"

**Marcus**: "I can actually think! There's space between the trigger and my response. I'm noticing options I wouldn't see when the energy is all up in my chest and head. Like in that investor meeting last week—I might have asked questions instead of making demands if I'd been in this state."

This represented a key insight about how physical grounding creates cognitive space for choice.

**From the Redirecting for Creative Purpose practice**:

**Marcus moved with strong but focused energy, gestures becoming more inclusive and directional rather than dominating.**

**Marcus**: "I was imagining directing this power toward building the company culture we need—something strong but not brittle. I could feel how this same energy could inspire rather than intimidate. It's not about being less powerful, it's about power with purpose."

**Coach**: "How might others respond differently to this form of power expression?"

**Marcus**: "They'd probably engage rather than retreat or resist. My CTO might actually tell me what he really thinks instead of just agreeing then doing his own thing later. This feels like leadership rather than just being in charge."

This integration point revealed a new understanding of effective power use that didn't require diminishing his natural assertiveness.

### Integration Process

Following the "Power Redirection" exercise, Marcus's integration journey included:

**Immediate Insights**:
- Recognition that his dominating style originated as a survival strategy in a chaotic family environment
- Awareness that reactive power often undermined his actual goals and influence
- Understanding that physical practices could interrupt reactivity patterns

**Integration Practices**:
1. "Power check-in" body scan before important meetings to identify and ground energy
2. Brief physical grounding practices when feeling triggered (feet on floor, deep breathing)
3. Martial arts training that channeled power impulses constructively
4. Pre-planned purposeful power statements for difficult conversations
5. Regular exercise to discharge excess energy that might otherwise emerge reactively

**Growth Edge Work**:
- Developing comfort with influence rather than control
- Building capacity for strategic thinking beyond immediate reactions
- Exploring Blue-stage appreciation for structure and process

### Results After Five Months

Marcus reported significant shifts:
- More productive leadership team meetings with increased team input
- Better relationships with key investors who previously found him difficult
- Reduction in impulsive decisions that had to be reversed later
- Ability to use his assertive energy selectively and strategically
- Greater leadership influence through inspiring rather than intimidating

**Critical Moment**: During a high-stakes investor negotiation, Marcus noticed his reactive power impulse arising but was able to ground it and redirect it toward articulating a compelling vision rather than making demands. The investor later commented that Marcus's leadership presence had "matured substantially."

### Coach's Reflections

Working with Marcus highlighted typical patterns in Red-stage shadow work:
- The power impulse itself is a vital energy that needs channeling, not suppressing
- Physical practices often work better than cognitive approaches at this stage
- Integration doesn't mean diminishing assertiveness but developing choice about its expression
- Red-stage clients often respond well to strength-based approaches that respect their power
- Shadow integration at this stage often involves distinguishing between power (a resource) and domination (one expression of power)

### Application for Similar Clients

This case demonstrates effective approaches for clients with Red-stage shadow patterns:
- Honor their action orientation and leadership drive while expanding options
- Use physical and somatic approaches rather than purely reflective methods
- Frame development as gaining power through choice rather than surrendering power
- Address the fear often underlying dominating behavior
- Create concrete practices that interrupt reactive patterns in the moment
