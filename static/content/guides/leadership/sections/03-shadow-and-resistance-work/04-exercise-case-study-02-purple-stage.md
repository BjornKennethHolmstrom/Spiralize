# Purple Stage: Example Exercise and Case Study

## Working with the Tribe-Centered Shadow

The Purple stage brings gifts of community connection, tradition, ritual awareness, and sense of belonging. However, its shadow often manifests as excessive dependency on the group, magical thinking, superstition, and fear of exclusion that can prevent individual growth and adaptability. This section provides a practical exercise and case study for working with Purple-stage shadows.

## Example Exercise: "Ritual of Belonging & Becoming" Symbolic Practice

### Purpose
This ritual-based exercise helps clients integrate their need for tribal belonging with emerging individual identity, addressing the Purple-stage shadow tendency toward group dependency and fear of separation.

### Setup
- **Format**: One-on-one coaching session (60-75 minutes)
- **Materials**: Symbolic objects (provided by client), paper, drawing materials, small container
- **Preparation**: Ask client to bring 3-5 small objects representing important communities or traditions in their life

### Ritual of Belonging & Becoming Exercise Script

#### Introduction (5-7 minutes)

**Coach**: "Today we'll explore what I call the 'Ritual of Belonging & Becoming'—a practice that honors your connections to community and tradition while creating space for your individual journey. Your ability to maintain meaningful ties to groups that matter to you is a significant strength. This exercise helps integrate that sense of belonging with your unique path forward. The format is somewhat ceremonial, acknowledging that rituals often help us navigate important transitions. Does this approach feel comfortable to you?"

**Setup Context**: "You've brought objects representing key communities or traditions in your life. We'll use these as anchors for exploring both your connections and your individual journey."

#### Ritual Process (40-45 minutes)

**Coach**: "We'll move through four phases of this ritual process, exploring different aspects of your relationship to community and identity. Take your time with each phase—there's no need to rush."

1. **Honoring Connections**

**Coach**: "Arrange your symbolic objects in a circle in front of you. Each represents a community, tradition, or group that has shaped who you are. Take a moment with each object, acknowledging what this connection has given you."

[Allow client 8-10 minutes]

**Deepening Questions**:
- "What values or strengths have you gained from each of these communities?"
- "What does belonging to these groups provide for you?"
- "Which of these connections feels most essential to your sense of self?"
- "What traditions or practices from these communities do you most value?"

2. **Exploring Shadow Patterns**

**Coach**: "Now, take a blank piece of paper. On one side, write or draw what you fear might happen if you moved beyond the expectations of these groups. What worries arise about stepping into your individual path? What might be lost?"

[Allow client 8-10 minutes]

**Coach**: "On the other side of the paper, write or draw what remains unborn or unexpressed when you prioritize belonging over your unique journey. What parts of yourself might be hidden or suppressed to maintain these connections?"

[Allow client 8-10 minutes]

**Reflection Questions**:
- "What patterns do you notice in your fears about separation or independence?"
- "Where might these fears have originated in your history?"
- "What price have you paid for maintaining certain connections?"
- "What gifts or capacities within you are waiting for expression?"

3. **Creating Integration Symbols**

**Coach**: "Now, take a new piece of paper and create a symbol or image that represents the integration of belonging AND becoming—a way of honoring your connections while allowing your individual journey to unfold. This isn't about choosing between community and self, but finding a way to honor both."

[Allow client 10-12 minutes for this creative expression]

**Deepening Questions**:
- "What does this integration symbol represent to you?"
- "How does it honor both connection and individuation?"
- "What becomes possible when you hold both these aspects together?"
- "What support would help you maintain this integration in daily life?"

4. **Commitment Ritual**

**Coach**: "For this final phase, you'll create a simple commitment to yourself about how you'll honor both belonging and becoming going forward. Write this commitment on a small piece of paper."

[Allow client 5 minutes]

**Coach**: "Now, place this commitment in the center of your circle of objects, symbolizing that your individual journey isn't separate from your connections but emerges within and alongside them. Take a moment to feel what this integration means for you."

[Allow client a few minutes of silent contemplation]

**Coach**: "To close this ritual, you might want to speak your commitment aloud, or simply gather your objects and commitment paper to take with you—whatever feels appropriate for marking this integration."

#### Integration Dialogue (10-15 minutes)

**Coach**: "Let's reflect on what emerged through this ritual process. What key insights are you taking with you?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. "What new understanding do you have about your relationship to groups and communities?"
2. "How might you honor your connections while allowing more of your individual self to emerge?"
3. "What practical steps could support this integration in your daily life?"
4. "What rituals or practices might help you remember this balance between belonging and becoming?"

## Case Study: Amara's Integration Journey

### Client Background
Amara, 28, was a first-generation professional from a close-knit cultural community who sought coaching to navigate tensions between family/community expectations and her emerging professional identity. She displayed characteristic Purple-stage patterns:

- Strong connection to family traditions and cultural practices
- Deep sense of responsibility to community expectations
- Difficulty making decisions without family input or approval
- Anxiety when considering paths different from traditional expectations
- Tendency toward magical thinking about consequences of breaking traditions
- Guilt about professional ambitions that would take her away from community
- Growing awareness that her dependency on group approval was limiting her growth

### Initial Assessment

In early sessions, Amara's language revealed her Purple center of gravity:
- "I need to know my family approves of my decisions"
- "I worry something bad will happen if I break with traditions"
- "When I consider moving away for the job opportunity, I feel almost physically ill"
- "I don't know who I would be outside of my community"

Shadow patterns included:
- Excessive dependency on family validation for decisions
- Superstitious thinking about consequences of separation
- Identity fusion with group roles and expectations
- Fear-based loyalty to traditions without discernment

### The Ritual of Belonging & Becoming Session

After establishing trust and acknowledging the genuine value of Amara's cultural connections, the coach introduced the "Ritual of Belonging & Becoming" to help her integrate community ties with individual development.

**Key Moments and Breakthroughs**:

**From the Honoring Connections phase**:

**Amara** brought five objects: a family heirloom bracelet, a religious text, a photograph of her extended family, a traditional spice used in her culture's cooking, and a scarf in colors representing her ethnic heritage.

**Amara**: "Arranging these in a circle, I realize how much these connections have given me—a sense of history, moral guidance, unconditional support, joy in shared experiences, and pride in my heritage. These aren't small things. They've shaped how I see the world and given me roots."

**Coach**: "Which of these connections feels most essential to your sense of self?"

**Amara**: "The family connection represented by this photograph. But I'm noticing something interesting—what I value most isn't their approval but their presence and love. I've been conflating the two, assuming I need to follow every expectation to maintain the connection itself."

This represented an important distinction between the connection itself and the conditions she had attached to it.

**From the Exploring Shadow Patterns phase**:

On the first side of her paper, Amara wrote and drew images representing her fears:

**Amara**: "I've written 'abandonment,' 'lost identity,' and 'punishment.' I realize I have this almost magical belief that if I choose a path my family doesn't approve of, I'll be completely cut off and lose everything—like the connection itself would disappear. And there's this vague fear of divine or cosmic punishment for breaking traditions."

On the second side, representing what remains unexpressed:

**Amara**: "I've drawn a bird with clipped wings, and written phrases like 'professional ambition,' 'geographical freedom,' and 'autonomous decision-making.' What's striking me is that these aren't rebellious or selfish desires—they're about growth and contribution, just in ways that might look different from our traditions."

**Coach**: "Where might these fears about separation have originated?"

**Amara**: "There are family stories about relatives who left the community and faced hardship—but I'm realizing these stories are told in ways that emphasize the danger of separation, not the complexity of their actual experiences. They've become almost like myths warning against individuation."

This insight revealed the narrative foundations of her magical thinking about separation.

**From the Creating Integration Symbols phase**:

**Amara** created a drawing of a tree with deep roots and branches reaching upward, with birds both nesting in and flying from the branches.

**Amara**: "This tree represents what I'm seeing now—that strong roots actually enable growth upward and outward. The birds represent the possibility of exploration while always having a home to return to. The relationship between roots and branches isn't antagonistic—they're part of the same living system."

**Coach**: "What becomes possible when you hold both these aspects together?"

**Amara**: "I can see that honoring my heritage doesn't have to mean limiting my growth. And pursuing my individual path doesn't have to mean rejecting my community. What becomes possible is a life that's both rooted AND expanding—where my growth might even bring new resources back to my community rather than taking me away from it permanently."

This integration symbol provided a powerful metaphor for holding both belonging and becoming.

**From the Commitment Ritual phase**:

**Amara wrote her commitment**: "I commit to honoring the roots that nourish me while allowing my branches to grow toward new light. I will carry my heritage within me as I explore new territories, finding ways to stay connected that don't require staying small. I will trust that authentic growth serves both myself and my community in the long term."

As she placed this in the center of her object circle, she became emotional:

**Amara**: "This feels like permission to be whole—not split between loyalty and growth. I feel both more connected to my roots and more free to grow, just by acknowledging that both are important."

### Integration Process

Following the "Ritual of Belonging & Becoming" exercise, Amara's integration journey included:

**Immediate Insights**:
- Recognition that fear of separation had led to unnecessary compliance rather than discernment
- Awareness that her community connection could be maintained while developing individual identity
- Understanding that some traditions nourished her while others limited her without clear purpose

**Integration Practices**:
1. Creation of a small altar in her home with symbols of both heritage and aspiration
2. Regular "roots and branches" journaling to reflect on integration
3. Deliberate practice distinguishing between essential cultural values and arbitrary expectations
4. Conversations with select family members about her emerging path, focusing on continuity rather than rupture
5. Development of personal rituals that honored heritage while marking her individual journey

**Growth Edge Work**:
- Building comfort with autonomous decision-making
- Developing discernment about tradition versus superstition
- Exploring Red-stage capacity for self-assertion and boundary-setting

### Results After Six Months

Amara reported significant shifts:
- Acceptance of the job opportunity that required relocation, with intentional practices for maintaining family connection
- Reduced anxiety when making decisions without family consultation
- More authentic religious practice based on personal meaning rather than fear
- Greater ability to distinguish between superstition and meaningful tradition
- Development of new community connections that honored her heritage while supporting growth

**Critical Moment**: When announcing her decision to relocate, Amara was able to frame it in terms of extending the family's influence and values into new territory rather than as a rejection. She created a special meal combining traditional dishes with elements representing her new path. Her family's response was mixed but largely supportive, which she was able to accept without abandoning her decision.
