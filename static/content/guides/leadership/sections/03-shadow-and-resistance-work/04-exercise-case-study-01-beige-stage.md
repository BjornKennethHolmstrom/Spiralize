# Beige Stage: Example Exercise and Case Study

## Working with the Survival-Driven Shadow

The Beige stage represents our most fundamental human needs for physical safety, sustenance, and basic physiological functioning. While rarely a permanent center of gravity in adult coaching clients, Beige patterns often emerge during periods of extreme stress, trauma, illness, or life-threatening situations. Its shadow typically manifests as overwhelming anxiety, catastrophizing, freeze responses, and disconnection from resources that could provide support. This section provides a practical exercise and case study for working with Beige-stage shadows when they arise.

## Example Exercise: "Safety Anchoring" Sensory Practice

### Purpose
This sensory-based exercise helps clients re-establish physical safety and resource awareness when facing overwhelming circumstances, addressing the Beige-stage shadow tendency toward freeze responses and disconnection from support systems.

### Setup
- **Format**: One-on-one coaching session (30-40 minutes)
- **Materials**: Comfortable seating, optional comfort objects (blanket, stress ball, etc.)
- **Preparation**: Create a quiet environment with minimal distractions, ensure privacy

### Safety Anchoring Exercise Script

#### Introduction (3-5 minutes)

**Coach**: "Today we'll explore what I call 'Safety Anchoring'—a practice that helps reconnect with basic physical safety and available resources when feeling overwhelmed. When we're facing major challenges or stressors, our nervous system can go into survival mode, making it difficult to access our full capacities. This exercise helps establish enough security to move beyond pure survival reactions. We'll use sensory awareness to help your nervous system recognize that in this moment, basic safety exists. Does this approach feel comfortable to you?"

**Setup Context**: "Think of a current situation where you've been feeling overwhelmed, where your concerns about basic security, health, or survival have been activated."

#### Sensory Anchoring Process (20-25 minutes)

**Coach**: "We'll move through a series of sensory practices, each designed to help your nervous system register safety in different ways. We'll go slowly, and you can pause or adjust any step that doesn't feel helpful."

1. **Physical Grounding**

**Coach**: "Let's begin by bringing awareness to physical contact points where your body is supported right now. Notice where you're sitting, the pressure and support of the chair or floor beneath you. Feel the weight of your body being fully supported."

[Guide client for 2-3 minutes]

**Coach**: "Now, intentionally press your feet into the floor, feeling the solidity beneath you. If comfortable, you might press your palms against your thighs or the arms of the chair, noticing the sensations of contact and pressure."

[Guide client for 2-3 minutes]

**Deepening Questions**:
- "What physical sensations are you most aware of right now?"
- "Where do you feel the most solid connection with your surroundings?"
- "How has your breathing changed as you've brought awareness to these contact points?"

2. **Sensory Orientation**

**Coach**: "Now let's gently engage your senses to help your nervous system orient to the present environment. First, name three things you can see right now in your surroundings."

[Allow client to identify visual elements]

**Coach**: "Now, notice two sounds you can hear, either in the room or from further away."

[Allow client to identify auditory elements]

**Coach**: "Finally, notice one physical sensation that feels neutral or pleasant in your body right now."

[Allow client to identify a physical sensation]

**Coach**: "This simple practice helps your brain register that you're safe enough in this moment to take in your surroundings, rather than being in immediate danger."

**Reflection Questions**:
- "What do you notice about your internal state after this orientation?"
- "How does your sense of the space around you compare to before we started?"
- "What shift, if any, do you notice in your breathing or muscle tension?"

3. **Resource Inventory**

**Coach**: "Next, we'll take inventory of basic resources available to you right now and in your broader environment. Let's start with the most fundamental: Do you currently have access to shelter, food, and water?"

[Allow client to acknowledge basic physical resources]

**Coach**: "Now, let's broaden to social resources: Who are one or two people you could reach out to if you needed support? You don't need to name them aloud if you prefer not to, just bring them to mind."

[Allow client time to identify social resources]

**Coach**: "Finally, what internal resources have helped you navigate challenges in the past? This might be physical strength, persistence, adaptability, or any quality that has served your survival."

[Allow client time to identify internal resources]

**Deepening Questions**:
- "How does bringing awareness to these resources affect your sense of security?"
- "Which resources feel most important or accessible to you right now?"
- "What additional resources might be available that you haven't yet considered?"

4. **Nervous System Regulation**

**Coach**: "For this final practice, we'll use breathing to help communicate safety to your nervous system. I'll guide you through a simple pattern that helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system—your body's 'rest and restore' mode."

**Coach**: "If comfortable, take a slightly deeper breath than normal, inhaling for a count of four. Then extend your exhale a little longer, for a count of six. The extended exhale helps signal safety to your nervous system. We'll continue this pattern for about two minutes."

[Guide client through regulated breathing for 2 minutes]

**Coach**: "Now, notice what's shifted in your body and mind since we began these practices. What feels different about your relationship to the challenging situation we started with?"

#### Integration Dialogue (5-10 minutes)

**Coach**: "Let's reflect on what you've experienced through these anchoring practices. What key awareness or shifts are you taking away?"

**Follow-up Questions**:
1. "What signs might help you recognize earlier when your system is going into survival mode?"
2. "Which of these practices felt most helpful for regaining a sense of safety?"
3. "How might you incorporate brief versions of these practices into daily life?"
4. "What support would help you maintain this foundation of basic safety?"

### Journal Follow-Up Assignment

## Case Study: Eliana's Integration Journey

### Client Background
Eliana, 41, sought coaching after experiencing serious health challenges and subsequent financial difficulties that triggered profound survival anxiety. Though normally functioning at higher developmental stages, her acute circumstances had activated Beige-stage survival patterns. She displayed characteristic Beige activation signs:

- Persistent anxiety about basic needs (food, shelter, medical care)
- Difficulty concentrating or thinking beyond immediate concerns
- Physical symptoms including sleep disturbance, appetite changes, and tension
- Disconnection from social support due to overwhelm
- Catastrophic thinking about the future
- Freeze responses when trying to make decisions about next steps
- Inability to access her usual problem-solving capabilities

### Initial Assessment

In early sessions, Eliana's language revealed her Beige activation:
- "I don't know how I'll survive if my health gets worse"
- "I can't think clearly enough to figure out what to do"
- "Sometimes I just sit and stare, unable to take any action"
- "It feels like there's no safe ground anywhere"

Shadow patterns included:
- Overwhelm leading to disconnection from available resources
- Catastrophizing beyond current realities
- Freeze response preventing access to problem-solving capacities
- Isolation from potential support due to survival shame

### The Safety Anchoring Session

After establishing a supportive relationship and acknowledging the legitimacy of her concerns, the coach introduced the "Safety Anchoring" practice to help Eliana establish enough security to access her broader capacities.

**Key Moments and Breakthroughs**:

**From the Physical Grounding practice**:

**Eliana** initially sat tensely, with shallow breathing and minimal movement.

**Eliana**: "When I actually focus on the chair supporting me and the floor under my feet... there's this surprising solidity. I hadn't realized how much I've been holding myself up, as if I couldn't trust anything to support me."

**Coach**: "What physical sensations are you most aware of right now?"

**Eliana**: "The release in my shoulders is most noticeable. I've been carrying them around my ears for weeks. And my breathing has dropped lower in my body. It's like parts of me are remembering they can rest, at least momentarily."

This represented a significant shift from her persistent physical tension pattern.

**From the Sensory Orientation practice**:

**Eliana**: "Looking around and really seeing what's here—my books, the sunlight, my cat—it's pulling me out of the tornado in my head. The sounds especially, the clock ticking and birds outside... they're so ordinary. It makes this moment feel more real than the catastrophes I've been living in mentally."

**Coach**: "What do you notice about your internal state after this orientation?"

**Eliana**: "There's more space. Like the world has expanded beyond the tight circle of my fears. I'm still concerned about everything, but it doesn't feel like it's all happening right this second anymore."

This marked an important distinction between legitimate concerns and immediate threats.

**From the Resource Inventory practice**:

Initially, Eliana struggled to identify resources beyond the most basic.

**Eliana**: "Yes, I do have shelter and food for now. But beyond that..." [long pause]

With gentle prompting, she began recognizing overlooked resources.

**Eliana**: "I forgot about my sister offering to help with medical paperwork. And my neighbor who keeps checking in. I've been so overwhelmed I've been avoiding them. And...I do have some savings left. It's not enough for everything, but it's something. I've been so focused on what's missing or what might disappear that I stopped seeing what's actually here."

**Coach**: "How does bringing awareness to these resources affect your sense of security?"

**Eliana**: "It's like small islands appearing in what felt like an endless ocean. Not complete safety, but places to rest and regroup. I've been so fixated on the worst-case scenario that I couldn't see the stepping stones."

This shift in perception began opening access to problem-solving capacities that had been offline.

**From the Nervous System Regulation practice**:

**Eliana** followed the extended exhale breathing pattern, visibly softening throughout.

**Eliana**: "That simple change to the breathing makes such a difference. It's like a message to my body that the emergency is not happening right this moment. I feel more... collected. Like parts of me that scattered in the crisis are coming back online."

**Coach**: "Now, notice what's shifted in your body and mind since we began. What feels different about your relationship to your situation?"

**Eliana**: "I still face the same problems, but they feel more like challenges I might navigate rather than a tsunami that will certainly destroy me. I can feel my thinking brain coming back. And there's this tiny bit of space between me and the fear, where maybe some solutions could emerge."

This integration point represented crucial access to higher cognitive functions previously hijacked by survival mechanisms.

### Integration Process

Following the "Safety Anchoring" exercise, Eliana's integration journey included:

**Immediate Insights**:
- Recognition that her isolation was intensifying her survival fear rather than protecting her
- Awareness that brief safety practices could interrupt catastrophic thought spirals
- Understanding that acknowledging real resources didn't negate legitimate concerns

**Integration Practices**:
1. "Sensory anchoring" practice 3-5 times daily, especially before making decisions
2. Creation of a visual "resource map" showing available supports
3. Brief daily connections with at least one support person
4. Physical routine incorporating regulated breathing and movement
5. "Reality testing" practice to distinguish between current reality and catastrophic projections

**Growth Edge Work**:
- Rebuilding access to Purple-stage community resources
- Developing Red-stage capacity for directed action despite uncertainty
- Regaining access to higher-stage problem-solving capabilities

### Results After Three Months

Eliana reported significant shifts:
- Establishment of a sustainable medical payment plan after accessing cognitive clarity
- Re-engagement with support network previously avoided due to overwhelm
- Improved sleep and reduced physical tension through regular regulation practices
- Ability to take incremental actions toward stability rather than freezing
- Beginning to access her professional skills again for part-time income

**Critical Moment**: When facing a new medical bill, Eliana was able to use her anchoring practices to avoid freezing, then methodically identified three possible approaches to address it. She noted: "Before, this would have sent me into a panic spiral where I couldn't think or act. Now I can feel the fear without being completely overtaken by it."

### Coach's Reflections

Working with Eliana highlighted typical patterns when Beige-stage survival mechanisms are activated:
- Physical safety practices create the foundation for accessing higher capacities
- Simple sensory techniques can interrupt catastrophic thinking patterns
- Integration doesn't mean dismissing legitimate concerns but establishing enough security to address them
- Clients often respond best to concrete, embodied approaches when in survival states
- Shadow integration at this stage often involves reconnecting with resources that overwhelm has obscured

### Application for Similar Clients

This case demonstrates effective approaches for clients with activated Beige-stage patterns:
- Prioritize nervous system regulation before cognitive problem-solving
- Use sensory and somatic approaches rather than abstract discussion
- Help identify and reconnect with overlooked resources
- Normalize survival responses without dwelling in them
- Create simple, repeatable practices that can interrupt freeze responses
