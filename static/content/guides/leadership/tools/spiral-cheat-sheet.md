## Spiral Dynamics Stages: Quick Reference

| **Stage** | **Core Need** | **Typical Language** | **Growth Edge Cue** | **Coaching Tip** |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 🔴 **Beige** | Survival | “I need safety, food, rest.” | “What would it feel like to connect with others once you’re safe?” | Ensure basic needs are met before coaching. Use simple, reassuring prompts. |
| 🟣 **Purple** | Belonging | “We stick together, honor traditions.” | “How might your group grow by trying something new?” | Build trust through group rituals or shared stories. Respect customs. |
| 🔴 **Red** | Power & Respect | “I want control, respect, action now.” | “What would it mean to earn respect through structure?” | Frame growth as a challenge to win. Be direct but non-confrontational. |

| 🟠 **Orange** | Success & Achievement | “I want results, progress, to win.” | “When was the last time you led without chasing results?” | Focus on measurable goals. Challenge them to define “success” deeply. |
| 🟢 **Green** | Harmony & Equality | “We need connection, fairness, empathy.” | “How can you make a tough call while staying true to your values?” | Emphasize collaboration. Gently nudge toward decisive action. |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Flexibility & Systems | “I see the big picture, integrate ideas.” | “How can your ideas create immediate impact for others?” | Engage with complex questions. Encourage practical application of insights. |
| 🔵 **Turquoise** | Holistic Balance | “It’s about global systems, collective good.” | “How can you ground your vision in today’s realities?” | Explore interconnected impacts. Support visionary, purpose-driven goals. |
