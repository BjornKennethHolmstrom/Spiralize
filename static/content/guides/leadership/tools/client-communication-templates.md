## How to Use These Templates

1. **Identify the Client’s Stage**: Use the [Spiral Stage Quiz](#spiral-stage-quiz) on spiralize.org or the [Spiral Cheat Sheet](#spiral-cheat-sheet) to determine the client’s center of gravity.
2. **Select the Template**: Choose the script for the relevant stage (e.g., Orange for achievement-focused clients, Coral for those with a transcendent mindset).
3. **Deliver with Empathy**: Use the script to affirm the client’s strengths, introduce coaching goals, and avoid jargon (e.g., say “your focus on connection” instead of “Green stage”).
4. **Follow Delivery Tips**: Apply the provided tips to tailor your tone and build rapport.
5. **Start with a Question**: Use the suggested follow-up question to transition into the session, drawing from the stage’s Core Questions (see [Coaching Questions by Stage](#coaching-questions)).
6. **Explore Further**: Refer to stage-specific files (e.g., [Blue Questions](#blue-questions)) for additional questions and cultural notes.
