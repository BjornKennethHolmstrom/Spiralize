# Transition Toolkit: Scripts for Navigating Stage Gap Tensions

Stage gaps become particularly challenging during transitions—whether these are developmental shifts between stages or major life changes that accentuate developmental differences. This section provides specific scripts and strategies for navigating these heightened tensions, helping adults guide children through periods of change while managing their own stage-related reactions.

## Understanding Transition Intensifiers

Transitions intensify stage gap challenges for several reasons:

1. **Stress Regression**: During transitions, both adults and children often temporarily regress to earlier stage behaviors under stress
2. **Stability Seeking**: Change increases the desire for familiar stage-based approaches as anchors
3. **Control Dynamics**: Uncertainty activates stage-specific control mechanisms
4. **Meaning Making**: Each stage interprets transitions through different meaning frames
5. **Safety Strategies**: Different stages define and seek safety in conflicting ways

These intensifiers can transform manageable stage gaps into significant conflicts—or, when navigated skillfully, into opportunities for growth and deeper understanding.

## Key Transition Types

### Developmental Transitions
When children are shifting between stages, creating tensions with adults at different stages:
- **Purple to Red**: Child's emerging autonomy clashes with family tradition
- **Red to Blue**: Child's developing sense of order conflicts with power-focused parenting
- **Blue to Orange**: Child's questioning of rules challenges traditional authority
- **Orange to Green**: Child's social consciousness clashes with achievement focus

### Life Transitions
Major changes that activate stage-based responses:
- **Family restructuring**: Divorce, remarriage, new siblings
- **Educational shifts**: Changing schools, teachers, or educational approaches
- **Residential moves**: Changing homes, neighborhoods, or communities
- **Health challenges**: Navigating illness, disability, or mental health needs
- **Developmental milestones**: Starting school, puberty, adolescence

## Script Framework for Navigating Transitions

Effective transition scripts follow a consistent structure while adapting to specific stage combinations:

### 1. Acknowledge the Transition
Begin by validating the reality of change in stage-appropriate language:

**For Purple-Stage Child**:
"Our family/tribe is going through a big change. Some things will feel different and that might feel scary sometimes."

**For Red-Stage Child**:
"A big change is happening. This might feel like a challenge to your strength, and that's normal."

**For Blue-Stage Child**:
"We're experiencing an important transition that affects our usual routines and expectations. This is a normal part of life."

**For Orange-Stage Child**:
"This transition presents both challenges and opportunities. Your ability to adapt is a skill that will serve you well."

**For Green-Stage Child**:
"This change affects everyone in different ways. All of our feelings about it are important and deserve to be heard."

### 2. Bridge Stage Perspectives
Address the specific stage gap by connecting different viewpoints:

**Blue Parent with Red Child During School Change**:
"While there will be new rules to learn at your new school (Blue perspective), this is also a chance for you to show how strong and capable you are in a new environment (Red perspective)."

**Orange Parent with Green Teen During Family Restructuring**:
"This family change will require some strategic adaptation (Orange perspective), and it's also important that we create space for everyone's feelings and needs in our new family configuration (Green perspective)."

**Red Parent with Blue Child During Health Challenge**:
"This health situation requires us to be strong and take action (Red perspective), and we'll create a clear plan with specific steps to follow that will help everyone know what to expect (Blue perspective)."

### 3. Provide Stage-Specific Security
Offer reassurance that addresses core stage needs:

**For Purple Security**:
"Our family bond remains strong through this change. We'll create new rituals to help us feel connected in our new situation."

**For Red Security**:
"You'll still have important choices and power in this new situation. Your strength will help us all through this transition."

**For Blue Security**:
"We'll establish clear new routines and expectations so everyone knows what's appropriate in this new situation."

**For Orange Security**:
"This change opens up new opportunities for growth and achievement. We'll identify specific goals for success in this new context."

**For Green Security**:
"Everyone's voice matters as we navigate this change together. We'll make sure each person feels included and valued."

### 4. Create Actionable Next Steps
Conclude with concrete actions aligned with relevant stages:

**Purple-Aligned Action**:
"Let's create a special transition object/ritual that we can use whenever we feel unsure during this change."

**Red-Aligned Action**:
"You get to choose one thing from our old home/situation to bring to our new one, showing what matters most to you."

**Blue-Aligned Action**:
"Let's create a transition schedule that shows exactly what will happen when, so we can follow the proper steps."

**Orange-Aligned Action**:
"Let's identify three specific goals that would make this transition successful from your perspective."

**Green-Aligned Action**:
"Let's plan a family/group meeting where everyone can share their feelings and ideas about this transition."

## Stage-Specific Scripts for Common Transitions

### Family Restructuring (Divorce/Remarriage)

#### For Purple-Stage Child (2-6 years)

**Script Context**: Explaining new family arrangements after parent remarriage

"Our family circle is growing bigger to include new people. Just like how our special [family tradition] shows we belong together, we'll create new special traditions with [new family members]. Our love magic is strong enough to include everyone.

I know it feels different from what we're used to. When the family circle changes, it can feel wobbly and scary. But you will always be a special part of our family, no matter what changes.

Let's create a special Family Book with pictures of everyone in our new, bigger family circle. We can look at it whenever you need to remember who belongs in our magic circle."

#### For Blue-Stage Child (6-12 years)

**Script Context**: Explaining parental divorce and new household arrangements

"Our family is going through an important change. Mom and Dad have decided we can't live together as one household anymore, but we will still be a family—just organized differently.

I know this isn't what you expected, and it's okay to feel upset when important rules change. Here's what you can count on: you will always be our child, both parents still love you, and we've created clear arrangements for when you'll be at each home.

Let's create a calendar together that shows exactly when you'll be at each house, what the expectations are at each home, and how you can stay connected to both parents. Having a clear plan will help everyone know what to expect during this transition."

### Educational Changes (Changing Schools)

#### For Red-Stage Child (4-8 years)

**Script Context**: Transitioning to a more structured school environment

"You're moving to a new school where you'll get to show your strength and power in new ways. This school has different rules than your old one, which might feel challenging at first—even for someone as strong as you.

The really powerful students know how to use their strength the right way in different places. This is your chance to show how mighty you are by conquering this new challenge.

Let's make a Power Plan for your first week. You get to choose one special thing to bring that helps you feel strong, and we'll practice three Mighty Moves you can use if you start feeling wobbly in your new territory."

#### For Orange-Stage Adolescent (10-16 years)

**Script Context**: Moving to a new school with different academic opportunities

"This school change presents both challenges and opportunities for your future success. While leaving your established position at your current school is difficult, the new environment offers advanced programs that better align with your goals.

Strategic adaptation to new environments is actually a valuable skill that top performers in any field develop. The most successful people know how to quickly analyze new situations and adjust their approach for maximum effectiveness.

Let's develop a 30-day Strategic Adaptation Plan with specific benchmarks for establishing yourself in the new environment. What key achievements would signal a successful transition in your view? Which strategic relationships should you establish first?"

### Residential Moves

#### For Green-Stage Teen (14-18 years)

**Script Context**: Family relocating to a new community

"This move affects each family member in different ways, and everyone's feelings about it are equally important. I understand you're concerned about leaving your friend group and the social causes you've been involved with.

While physical distance will change, meaningful connections can continue and transform in new ways. This is also an opportunity to expand your community and bring your inclusive values to a new environment that might benefit from your perspective.

Let's plan a proper goodbye ritual with your current community and research social justice organizations in our new location. What values from your current community would you like to bring to our new one? How might we create a more inclusive transition for everyone in the family?"

#### For Mixed Stage Family with Young Children

**Script Context**: Moving to a new home in the same community

[Purple element] "Our family nest is moving to a new special place, but our family magic stays strong wherever we go.

[Red element] You'll each get to be powerful helpers in our move, with important jobs that only you can do.

[Blue element] We'll follow a clear moving plan with proper steps so everyone knows what happens when.

Let's create a special Moving Day Story Book where we draw pictures of our old home, our journey to the new home, and what we're looking forward to in our new special place. Each of you can choose one special job for moving day and one special object to carry personally to our new home."

### Health Transitions

#### For Blue-Stage Child (6-12 years)

**Script Context**: Adapting to a chronic health condition requiring new routines

"Your body is going through an important change that means we need to establish new proper procedures to keep you healthy. Having these clear routines will help your body work the way it should.

I know new rules and routines can feel overwhelming at first, but learning to follow them correctly is the responsible thing to do. Many respected people manage similar health conditions by following the right procedures faithfully.

Let's create a Health Hero Chart with all the proper steps you need to follow each day. Each time you complete them correctly, you'll earn a stamp showing you've fulfilled your important responsibility. After collecting seven stamps, you'll receive a special recognition of your commitment to doing the right thing for your health."

#### For Orange-Stage Teen (10-16 years)

**Script Context**: Supporting a parent through serious illness

"This health situation presents our family with a significant challenge that will require strategic adaptation from all of us. While your parent's illness affects our normal functioning, how effectively we respond can actually build valuable skills and resilience.

Many successful people have navigated family health challenges while still pursuing their important goals, though it requires careful planning and efficient use of resources.

Let's develop a Family Adaptation Strategy that balances supporting your parent while maintaining your academic progress. What specific responsibilities make sense for you to take on? How can we redesign family systems to optimize both care and your continued achievement? What resources could help us manage this situation more effectively?"

## Handling Stage-Related Resistance During Transitions

When stage gaps create resistance to necessary transitions, these approaches help address the underlying stage needs:

### Purple Resistance
**Signs**: Clinging to old patterns, separation anxiety, regressive behaviors
**Needs**: Security, belonging, magical safety
**Effective Response**: "I understand this feels scary because it's different from what we're used to. Our family's love magic is strong enough to keep us connected even when things change. Let's create a special object/ritual that carries our connection with us through this change."

### Red Resistance
**Signs**: Power struggles, defiance, aggressive reactions to change
**Needs**: Control, strength, immediate impact
**Effective Response**: "This change is a big challenge, and I see how strong your feelings are about it. Powerful people like you can influence how this change happens. Let's identify three specific choices you can make that would show your strength during this transition."

### Blue Resistance
**Signs**: Rigid adherence to old rules, moral judgments about changes, anxiety about proper behavior
**Needs**: Clear expectations, moral rightness, proper procedures
**Effective Response**: "I understand this change disrupts our usual proper procedures, which feels uncomfortable. Let's create a clear transition plan with specific steps and new rules that will help us maintain order through this change. What rightful expectations would help you feel this transition is being handled properly?"

### Orange Resistance
**Signs**: Strategic arguments against change, focus on how transition hurts achievement goals
**Needs**: Pathways to success, strategic advantage, measurable progress
**Effective Response**: "I recognize this transition impacts your goals and progress path. Let's analyze what new opportunities this change might create and develop a strategic adaptation plan. How could you leverage this change to develop skills that would actually enhance your long-term success?"

### Green Resistance
**Signs**: Emotional processing loops, concern about everyone's feelings, group-focused objections
**Needs**: Inclusive process, emotional validation, relational harmony
**Effective Response**: "I hear how much you care about how this change affects everyone in our community. Your concern for the group is valuable. Let's create a space where everyone can share their feelings about this transition and collaborate on ways to make it more inclusive and supportive for all."

## Supporting Children Through Adult Stage Transitions

Sometimes adults undergo their own developmental shifts, creating confusion for children accustomed to previous parenting approaches. These scripts help explain changing parental behaviors:

### Parent Shifting from Blue to Orange
**To Child**: "I'm learning that there are different ways to be a good parent besides just following all the usual rules. I still believe in important family values, but I'm also seeing that helping you find your own path to success matters too. Some of my expectations might change as I learn and grow, just like you're learning and growing too."

### Parent Shifting from Orange to Green
**To Child**: "I'm discovering that while achievement is important, relationships and how we feel about ourselves matter deeply too. I still want you to succeed, but I'm also learning to value our connection and your unique qualities beyond just your accomplishments. I may focus more on listening to your feelings than I used to, because I'm growing in my understanding too."

### Parent Shifting from Red to Blue
**To Child**: "I'm learning that having clear family rules helps everyone, not just showing who's strongest. I still value courage and standing up for yourself, but I'm also seeing that having predictable expectations makes our home safer for everyone. This means I'll be more consistent rather than just reacting in the moment."

## The SHIFT Conversation Model for Transitions

When navigating transition conversations, use the SHIFT model to address stage gaps effectively:

**S - Stage recognition**: Identify the relevant stages and potential gaps
"I recognize that you see this situation from a perspective that values [stage value], while I'm approaching it from a view that emphasizes [different stage value]."

**H - Honor both viewpoints**: Validate multiple perspectives
"Both of these viewpoints have important wisdom to offer as we navigate this change."

**I - Identify shared purpose**: Find common ground despite differences
"We both want to ensure this transition leads to [shared goal], even if we see different pathways there."

**F - Frame stage-appropriate responses**: Translate ideas across stages
"For you, this might look like [stage-aligned approach], while for me it feels important to [different stage approach]. Perhaps we can find a way that honors both."

**T - Translate into action**: Create concrete next steps
"Let's try [specific action that bridges perspectives] as our first step in navigating this change together."

## Special Needs Considerations During Transitions

Children with neurodevelopmental differences often need additional support during transitions, with stage-sensitive adaptations:

### Autism Spectrum

**Transition Challenges**: 
- Greater need for predictability and routine
- More pronounced reactions to change
- Potential sensory overwhelm in new environments
- Difficulty with implicit social rules in new contexts

**Stage-Sensitive Support**:
- **Purple+**: Create transition objects with sensory characteristics from familiar settings
- **Blue+**: Provide explicit visual schedules and social stories about changes
- **Orange+**: Develop clear metrics for "success" in navigating the transition
- **Green+**: Create social support structures that accommodate sensory needs

**Sample Script** (Blue-frame for 9-year-old with autism facing school change):
"When we change to your new school, things will follow a different order than what you're used to. This visual schedule shows exactly what will happen each day in your new classroom. We've created a special School Transition Map with pictures of all the important places and people, with the specific rules for each area. We'll practice following this map five times before your first day so your body knows exactly what to expect."

### ADHD

**Transition Challenges**:
- Executive function demands increase during transitions
- New routines require additional working memory and organization
- Transitions may reduce external structure temporarily
- Medication effectiveness may fluctuate with changing routines

**Stage-Sensitive Support**:
- **Red+**: Create high-energy transition activities that channel arousal constructively
- **Blue+**: Develop simple, consistent routines with visual reminders
- **Orange+**: Break transition goals into achievable chunks with quick feedback
- **Green+**: Ensure emotional support during executive function challenges

**Sample Script** (Orange-frame for 13-year-old with ADHD during family restructuring):
"This family change requires effective adaptation strategies, which can be challenging when your brain processes things differently. Let's create a Strategic Transition Toolkit with specific tools for each new situation: a visual checklist for moving between homes, reminder cards for new routines, and a quick-reference guide for each household's systems. What specific challenges do you anticipate, and what practical tools would help you navigate them successfully?"

## The Transition Support Plan

To navigate significant transitions across stage gaps, create a structured approach:

1. **Assess the Transition**: Identify the specific change and its implications
2. **Map Stage Perspectives**: Note how different stages view this transition
3. **Identify Potential Conflicts**: Anticipate where stage gaps might create tension
4. **Create Translation Bridges**: Develop language that connects different perspectives
5. **Design Ritual Elements**: Include transition rituals that honor different stage needs
6. **Establish Feedback Loops**: Create ways to check how the transition is progressing
