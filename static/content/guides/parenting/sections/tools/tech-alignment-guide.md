# Technology Alignment Guide

The **Technology Alignment Guide** is a comprehensive tool within the **Spiral-Aware Parenting & Education Guide** designed to align digital tools and platforms with **Spiral Dynamics** stages (**Beige** to **Green**, with rare **Yellow**, **Turquoise**, and **Coral**) to support children’s developmental needs. This guide details stage-specific apps, platforms, screen time boundaries, and assessment methods for core subjects (e.g., Language Arts, Mathematics) and supplementary areas (e.g., Social-Emotional Learning, Arts). It facilitates **stage transitions**, **stage-mixing**, and **major life events** (e.g., school transitions, family changes) while ensuring inclusivity for neurodivergent learners and diverse cultural/socioeconomic contexts.

## Purpose

The **Technology Alignment Guide** aims to:

- Provide parents and educators with stage-specific recommendations for digital tools to align with children’s **Spiral Dynamics** stages.
- Detail tool functionalities, screen time boundaries, and assessment methods to foster engagement, academic progress, and emotional well-being.
- Support **stage transitions**, **stage-mixing**, and **major life events** by recommending flexible, developmentally appropriate technologies.
- Ensure inclusivity by adapting tool selections and usage for neurodivergent learners and diverse cultural/socioeconomic contexts.

This guide builds on **Technology Integration** (Section V), **Developmental Signals & Needs** (Section I), **Parenting Foundations** (Section II), **Pedagogies** (Section III), **Curriculum Transformation** (Section IV), and **Implementation** (Section VI). It integrates with the **Child Stage Quiz**, **Spiral Technology Planner**, **Spiral Curriculum Planner**, **Spiral Stage Timeline**, and **Individual Progress Tracker** (available on Spiralize.org).

## How to Use the Technology Alignment Guide

1. **Identify Stages**: Use the **Child Stage Quiz** (Spiralize.org) to determine the child’s or group’s current **Spiral Dynamics** stage(s), noting **stage-mixing** (e.g., **Blue** with **Orange** traits).
2. **Select Tools**: Choose stage-specific digital tools from the guide below, focusing on core subjects (e.g., Language Arts, Mathematics) and supplementary areas (e.g., SEL, Arts).
3. **Implement Strategies**: Apply recommended tools with stage-appropriate activities and screen time boundaries, referencing **Stage-Specific Technology Use** (Section V.01) and **Benefits and Risks** (Section V.02).
4. **Support Transitions/Events**: Adapt tool usage during **stage transitions** or **major life events** using the **Transition Toolkit** (Sections II, IV, V) to maintain developmental alignment.
5. **Ensure Inclusivity**: Incorporate adaptations for neurodivergent learners (e.g., low-stimulation interfaces for autistic children) and diverse contexts (e.g., free tools for low-resource settings), per **Special Needs Considerations** (Section V.05).
6. **Track Progress**: Monitor tool effectiveness using the **Individual Progress Tracker** (Spiralize.org) and adjust selections with the **Spiral Technology Planner**.
7. **Collaborate and Share**: Share tool recommendations and outcomes with family, educators, or the #SpiralParenting community (Spiralize.org) to align home and school practices.
