# Spiral Scripts: Stage-Aligned Language for Common Parenting Moments

Responding effectively to children during challenging moments requires language that resonates with their developmental stage. These **Spiral Scripts** provide ready-to-use, stage-aligned responses for common parenting and teaching scenarios, helping adults communicate in ways that children can truly hear and integrate. By matching your language to a child's **Spiral Dynamics** stage, you can transform difficult moments into opportunities for connection and growth.

## The Power of Stage-Aligned Communication

When a child is experiencing a challenging moment—whether a tantrum, disappointment, conflict, or transition—their ability to process information becomes even more stage-dependent than usual. Language that might work beautifully for a **Blue**-stage child focused on rules and order can completely miss a **Purple**-stage child who needs magical thinking and ritual to make sense of their experience.

These scripts are designed to:

- Provide immediate, practical language for common challenging scenarios
- Align communication with the child's developmental stage for greater resonance
- Support healthy navigation of **stage transitions** and **stage-mixing**
- Bridge **stage gaps** between parents/teachers and children
- Help adults respond thoughtfully rather than reactively during difficult moments
- Create opportunities for developmental growth within everyday challenges

Remember that these scripts are starting points, not rigid formulas. The most effective communication always adjusts to the specific child, relationship, cultural context, available resources, and situation. Observe how children respond, track their progress using the **Individual Progress Tracker** (available on Spiralize.org), and adapt your approach accordingly.

## How to Use These Scripts

1. **Identify the child's primary stage** using the **Child Stage Quiz** or by observing their typical behaviors and needs
2. **Recognize the scenario** that matches your current situation
3. **Review the stage-aligned script** for that scenario
4. **Adapt the language** to your personal style, cultural context, and available resources
5. **Deliver with authenticity**, maintaining connection through tone and body language
6. **Observe the response** and track effectiveness using the **Individual Progress Tracker**
7. **Adjust as needed** based on the child's reaction and developmental progress

The most effective scripts are delivered with genuine connection, appropriate pacing, and attunement to the child's emotional state. Even perfect words fall flat when rushed or delivered without warmth and presence.

## Scripts for Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Handling a Tantrum or Emotional Outburst

**Beige Stage (0-2 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Beige-stage infants need sensory regulation, physical comfort, and attunement to process overwhelming sensations and emotions, which they experience primarily through their bodies.*

*Verbal script (primarily for caregiver self-guidance):* "I see you're overwhelmed by big sensations right now. Your body needs help calming down. I'll use a gentle, rhythmic voice and slow, predictable movements to help you feel safe."

*Non-verbal script:* Make eye contact at the child's level. Use a calm, melodic voice tone with exaggerated prosody. Offer rhythmic patting or rocking at about 70 beats per minute (slightly slower than a heartbeat). Provide deep pressure touch if the child responds well to it. Maintain a calm facial expression with occasional slow nods.

*Low-resource adaptation:* Use your body as the primary resource—voice, touch, facial expressions, and movement patterns require no materials. Wrap the child in available fabric for added deep pressure input.

*Technology adaptation:* Play white noise or gentle rhythmic sounds on a mobile device if available and appropriate.

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which sensory inputs calmed most effectively? (2) How long did it take to return to regulation? (3) What preceded the dysregulation?

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking, ritual, and symbolic reassurance to process big emotions that feel overwhelming and mysterious to them.*

"I see your body is having really big feelings right now. Sometimes feelings can feel like wild weather inside us—like a storm that feels scary. Let's find our special calm-down spot where the storm can't get us. Would you like to hold our special calming stone while we take some dragon breaths together? Remember how we breathe fire out slowly like our friend from the story? The storm always passes, and I'll stay right here with you until it does."

*Follow-up when calm:* "What color was your storm? Should we draw a picture of it going away? Let's create a special spell to keep in our pocket for next time the storm comes."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's find our calm-down spot where the storm can't get us. Can you show me how slowly you can breathe out, like you're cooling hot soup? I'll count the magic numbers while you breathe: one, two, three..."

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our family has a special way of helping storm feelings. Let's do our family calm-down ritual together. When we breathe together, our hearts connect and the storm can't stay."

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use our special calm-down app that shows the breathing bubble getting bigger and smaller? We can watch it together while we take our dragon breaths."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which magical/ritual elements resonated most? (2) What metaphors helped create meaning? (3) How quickly did regulation follow the ritual process?

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need acknowledgment of their power and autonomy while still receiving guidance to channel their strong emotions.*

"Wow, those are some powerful feelings you're showing! Your body looks super strong right now. You get to have big feelings—everyone does—but you also get to be the boss of how you show them. Would you rather stomp those feelings out like a dinosaur over here, or punch them into this pillow like a superhero? You're strong enough to handle these feelings, and I'm right here while you show me how you can take charge of them your way."

*Follow-up when calm:* "You found a way to be the boss of those big feelings. What worked best? What power move might work even better next time?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Those are powerful feelings! You're strong enough to be the boss of them. Would you rather run in place really fast or push against the wall with all your might? Show me how powerful you can be while handling these feelings."

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Those are strong feelings! In our family/community, strong people know how to handle big feelings in ways that keep everyone safe. Would you like to be the feeling warrior who shows others how to be strong AND wise with emotions?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use the superhero emotions app where you can defeat the feeling monsters by tapping them away? Or would you rather use your real power moves first?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which power-based regulation strategy was chosen? (2) How effectively did the child regain control? (3) How did emphasizing strength impact the duration of the emotional outburst?

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear structures, rules about appropriate expression, and proper procedures for handling emotions.*

"I understand you're feeling upset, and it's okay to have those feelings. There are right ways and not-so-right ways to show them. Taking three deep breaths is step one of our family upset plan. Then we use our words to explain the problem clearly. Would you like to write it down first or tell me directly? Remember, in our family we talk about solutions after we've calmed our bodies down. What's the next step in our plan that you could use right now?"

*Follow-up when calm:* "You followed our steps for handling upset feelings. Which step helped the most? Is there anything we should add to our plan for next time?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's follow our steps for handling upset feelings. First, three deep breaths. Second, explain the problem clearly. Third, think of solutions. Which step are you ready for now?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "In our family/community, we have special steps for handling strong feelings that help everyone stay in harmony. Let's follow our proper steps together: breathe, explain, find solutions that restore peace."

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use the feelings chart app to identify exactly what you're feeling? Then we can check off each step of our emotion management plan on the digital tracker."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which steps were followed successfully? (2) How well did the structure support regulation? (3) Did the child reference the procedure independently?

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic approaches to managing emotions and achieving their goals, even during upsets.*

"I see you're really frustrated right now. What outcome are you trying to achieve in this situation? Let's think strategically about this—how effective is this emotional response likely to be in getting you toward your goal? What approach might work better? You're skilled at finding solutions—what strategy could you try now that might be more successful? I'm here to help you think this through if you want another perspective."

*Follow-up when calm:* "What did you learn from this situation that you might apply next time? What strategy worked or might work better?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's analyze this situation objectively. What's your desired outcome? Is your current approach effective? What alternative strategy might work better?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Your strategic thinking is valuable to our family/community. How might you channel this emotion into an approach that both achieves your goals and supports our group's success? What would an effective leader do in this situation?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use the goal-tracking app to step back and reconnect with your bigger objectives? Sometimes seeing the larger strategy helps put current emotions in perspective."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What strategic reframing was most effective? (2) How quickly did problem-solving replace emotional reactivity? (3) What insights did the adolescent generate about effectiveness?

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need acknowledgment of the social and emotional complexity of situations, with emphasis on everyone's feelings and perspectives.*

"It seems like there's a lot coming up for you emotionally right now, and that's completely valid. Everyone's feelings matter, including yours. Would it help to talk through what you're experiencing and how this situation is affecting you? I wonder how others involved might be feeling too. When you're ready, we could explore different perspectives together and think about how to honor everyone's needs, including your own. What support would feel most helpful right now?"

*Follow-up when calm:* "How did the emotions provide important information about what matters to you? How might understanding everyone's perspectives help in similar situations?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Your feelings are valid, and so are the feelings of others involved. Let's take time to understand all perspectives. What would help create space for everyone's needs to be heard?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "These emotions are important signals about our connections with each other. How might these feelings be showing us what our community needs? What would restore harmony while honoring everyone's experience?"

*Technology adaptation:* "There's an empathy-building app that guides perspective-taking exercises. Would that help process the social dynamics at play here? Or would you prefer to talk through the different viewpoints together?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How readily did the adolescent consider multiple perspectives? (2) What insights emerged about interpersonal dynamics? (3) How did empathy affect emotional regulation?

**Yellow Stage (16-18+, rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need acknowledgment of systemic patterns and contextual complexity, with space for integrative thinking that transcends either/or positions.*

"I notice you're experiencing a strong emotional response in this situation. I'm curious about what patterns or systems you see operating here that might be triggering this reaction. From what contextual perspective does this make the most sense to you? Emotions often signal important information about system dynamics that our cognitive mind hasn't fully processed yet. What multiple perspectives might help illuminate what's happening here? How might this emotional response be serving an important function within the larger context?"

*Follow-up when calm:* "What insights emerged from navigating that emotional experience? How might this pattern connect to other systems or contexts in your life?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "What systemic patterns do you notice in this situation? How might your emotional response be providing information about those patterns? What principles might guide an adaptive approach here?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "How do you see your emotional response connecting to larger patterns in our community? What wisdom might emerge if we view this through multiple cultural lenses simultaneously? How might different valid perspectives together create a more complete understanding?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Would mapping this situation in the systems thinking app help visualize the different forces and patterns at play? Technology can sometimes help us see connections we might otherwise miss."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What systemic patterns did the adolescent identify? (2) How effectively were they able to hold multiple perspectives? (3) What integrative insights emerged from the emotional experience?

**Turquoise Stage (18+, extremely rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Turquoise-stage individuals need acknowledgment of holistic, interconnected awareness and space for intuitive knowing alongside cognitive understanding.*

"I notice there's a strong energetic response moving through you right now. What larger patterns or fields of consciousness might this emotion be connected to? How does this experience resonate across different levels of awareness—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual? There might be a deeper knowing trying to emerge that transcends ordinary emotional reactions. What intuitive understanding is present beneath the surface of this experience? How might this moment be connected to larger evolutionary processes at work in your life or in the broader systems you're part of?"

*Follow-up when calm:* "What holistic understanding emerged from that experience? How did different levels of awareness—body, emotions, mind, spirit—inform each other? What evolutionary purpose might this process be serving?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "What deeper knowing might be trying to emerge through this emotional experience? How does this moment connect to the larger flow of your life and beyond? What wisdom is available when you attend to all levels of awareness simultaneously?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "How might this experience be connected to the collective consciousness of our community and beyond? What ancestral wisdom and future potentials are converging in this moment? How might this serve the evolution of our shared field of awareness?"

*Technology adaptation:* "While technology has limitations in addressing consciousness directly, would a brief guided meditation app help integrate the different dimensions of this experience? Sometimes digital tools can support deeper awareness."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What holistic connections did the individual perceive? (2) How readily did they access intuitive knowing alongside cognitive understanding? (3) What evolutionary perspective emerged from the integration process?

### Scenario 2: Setting Boundaries and Limits

**Beige Stage (0-2 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Beige-stage infants need sensory clarity, physical guidance, and consistent patterns to internalize basic boundaries.*

*Verbal script (primarily for caregiver self-guidance):* "You're exploring with your body, and I'll help keep you safe. I'll use clear, simple signals to guide your movements."

*Non-verbal script:* Use gentle physical redirection rather than verbal commands. Create physical boundaries using your body or simple barriers. Use consistent sounds or gestures (like a gentle "ah-ah" or head shake) paired with redirection. Demonstrate delight with wide eyes and smiles when the infant explores within safe boundaries.

*Low-resource adaptation:* Your body is the primary resource—consistent facial expressions, sounds, and physical guidance require no materials.

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* Involve multiple family members in maintaining consistent responses to boundary-testing, creating a communal field of guidance.

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which physical redirections were most effective? (2) What consistent signals did the infant begin to recognize? (3) How quickly did redirection lead to adapted behavior?

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking and ritual to understand and accept boundaries that feel arbitrary to them.*

"In our family/classroom, we have a special rule about [touching gently/staying nearby/using inside voices]. This magical rule keeps everyone safe and happy, just like walls keep our house cozy and safe from the weather. Your job is to be the special guardian of this rule! Should we create a special hand signal to remind us about our gentle touches? When we follow this special rule, it's like we're all protected by an invisible shield of kindness!"

*Reinforcement:* "I notice you being an amazing guardian of our gentle-touch rule! Your magical shield of kindness is super strong today!"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Our family has a special saying about gentle touches that keeps everyone safe. Can you be the magic word keeper who remembers our saying? When I whisper 'gentle hands,' you'll remember the magic spell that protects everyone."

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our ancestors gave us special wisdom about how to live together happily. This rule about [specific boundary] is like a precious gift that keeps our family/community safe. Everyone has the important job of protecting this wisdom."

*Technology adaptation:* "Should we set the special boundary reminder on our device? When it plays the magical sound, it will help remind everyone about our special rule."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which magical metaphors resonated most effectively? (2) How independently did the child reference the boundary concept? (3) What ritual elements supported boundary internalization?

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need to feel powerful even within necessary limits, with acknowledgment of their strength and autonomy.*

"You have so much amazing energy and strength! And strong people get to make choices about how they use their power. You can choose to use your strength to [move quickly outside instead of inside/use strong words instead of hitting/etc.]. Powerful people know where the boundaries are—that's what makes them truly strong. Which powerful choice will you make right now? I know you can handle this boundary because you're developing great strength."

*Reinforcement:* "You just showed how powerful you really are by making a strong choice about how to use your energy!"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Show me how strong you are by controlling your power! Real strength means choosing how to use your energy. Which powerful choice will you make right now?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "In our community, the most respected leaders know how to use their strength wisely. You can be like those powerful leaders by showing how you control your energy. Our people have always honored those who use their power in ways that help the group."

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use the power choice app where you can see what strong characters choose in different situations? Or would you rather show your own power of self-control right now?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which power-based language was most motivating? (2) How did framing boundaries as choices affect compliance? (3) What aspects of strength did the child seem most drawn to?

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear rules with logical reasons, emphasizing proper behavior and responsibility.*

"In our family/classroom, we have an important rule about [specific boundary]. This rule exists because [clear reason tied to order/safety/respect]. When everyone follows this rule, things work well for the whole group. Part of growing up is learning to follow important rules even when we might not feel like it. I know you're responsible enough to do the right thing here. What's the proper choice in this situation?"

*Reinforcement:* "You showed real responsibility by following our important rule. That's what helps our family/classroom function properly."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Our rule about [specific boundary] helps everything work properly. Making the right choice shows real responsibility. What is the correct thing to do in this situation?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our rules maintain the proper order that our community depends on. By following this rule, you bring honor to our family/group and show respect for our traditions. What is the proper way to act in this situation?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Let's check the family rules chart on our device. It shows exactly what's expected and why the rule matters. Following digital organization systems is another way to show responsibility."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How well did the child articulate the reason behind the rule? (2) How consistently was the boundary respected? (3) What indicators of pride in responsible behavior were observed?

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic reasoning for boundaries, with emphasis on how boundaries serve their personal goals and success.*

"I understand you want [what they're pushing for]. Let's discuss this boundary of [specific limit] and why it exists. How might this boundary actually help you achieve your longer-term goals? Sometimes short-term limitations create space for bigger successes later. What would a strategic approach to this situation look like? I'm open to hearing your perspective on how we might make this work effectively for everyone involved."

*Reinforcement:* "The way you thought strategically about this boundary and found a workable solution shows real maturity and foresight."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's analyze how this boundary relates to your goals. What strategic advantage might come from working within this limitation? What approach would be most effective?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Strategic thinking is valued in our community when it serves both individual advancement and group success. How might respecting this boundary position you for leadership while supporting our shared values?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The goal-setting app might help visualize how this boundary connects to your longer-term objectives. Digital tools can sometimes clarify the strategic implications of current choices."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What strategic reasoning did the adolescent develop? (2) How did connecting to personal goals affect boundary acceptance? (3) What negotiations or adaptations emerged from the strategic discussion?

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need collaborative approaches to boundaries that honor everyone's perspectives and feelings.*

"This boundary around [specific limit] affects everyone in our family/group. I'd like to understand your perspective on it, and I'd also like to share how I see it. Everyone's needs matter here. How might we find an approach that respects both your desire for [what they want] and the need for [reason for boundary]? Perhaps we can explore a solution together that honors multiple perspectives and still maintains necessary boundaries."

*Reinforcement:* "The way you considered everyone's needs while working within this boundary shows real emotional intelligence and care for the community."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's take time to understand how everyone is affected by this boundary. What matters to you about this, and what might matter to others? How can we find common ground?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How readily did the adolescent consider multiple perspectives? (2) What collaborative solutions were generated? (3) How was empathy expressed during the boundary discussion?

**Yellow Stage (16-18+, rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need flexible, context-sensitive boundaries that acknowledge complexity and adaptive principles rather than rigid rules.*

"I see we're navigating this boundary around [specific limit]. I'm curious about the underlying principles at play here rather than just the surface rule. What functions does this boundary serve in different contexts? When might it be most relevant, and when might a different approach better serve the deeper principles? I'm open to examining this from multiple perspectives and considering adaptive approaches based on context rather than applying a one-size-fits-all solution. What functional alternatives might address the core needs while respecting the complexity of the situation?"

*Reinforcement:* "Your ability to see beyond the simple boundary to the underlying principles and adapt based on context shows remarkable integrative thinking."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "What core principles does this boundary serve? How might those principles be honored in different ways depending on the specific context? What adaptive approach makes most sense here?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Different wisdom traditions have approached this boundary in varied ways while serving similar underlying principles. How might we integrate diverse cultural perspectives into an approach that's adaptive to our current context while honoring essential principles?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Digital systems thinking tools might help map the different factors and principles at play in this boundary situation. Technology can sometimes help visualize complex interrelationships."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What principles did the adolescent identify behind the boundary? (2) How context-sensitive was their proposed approach? (3) What integrative thinking emerged in addressing the boundary?

**Turquoise Stage (18+, extremely rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Turquoise-stage individuals need boundaries that honor holistic awareness, evolutionary purpose, and interconnected systems while allowing for emergent possibilities.*

"This boundary exists within a larger web of interconnected needs and patterns. I'm curious how you're sensing it from a holistic perspective. How might this limitation serve an evolutionary purpose within the systems we're part of? What wisdom emerges when we attend to both the explicit boundary and the implicit field of possibilities around it? Rather than seeing this as simply a restriction, how might it be creating a container for something important to emerge? What becomes possible when we honor both structure and flow, both limitation and openness?"

*Reinforcement:* "The way you've engaged with this boundary—holding both its form and its evolutionary purpose simultaneously—reflects a remarkable holistic awareness."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "How do you sense this boundary serving the evolution of the whole system? What emerges when we honor both the limitation and the possibilities it creates? What wisdom is available when we attend to both form and flow?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Ancestral wisdom across many traditions has recognized how certain boundaries create sacred containers for collective evolution. How might this limitation be serving our community's development in ways that transcend yet include our immediate preferences?"

*Technology adaptation:* "While technology has limitations in addressing consciousness directly, perhaps the holistic systems visualization app might offer a partial mapping of the interconnected factors at play. Digital tools, despite their limitations, can sometimes support broader awareness."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What holistic perspective did the individual bring to the boundary? (2) How did they connect immediate limitations to evolutionary purpose? (3) What emergent possibilities did they perceive within the boundary container?

### Scenario 3: Navigating Peer Conflicts

**Beige Stage (0-2 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Beige-stage infants need sensory regulation, physical safety, and co-regulation during conflicts over objects or attention.*

*Verbal script (primarily for caregiver self-guidance):* "You're having big feelings about sharing space/toys. I'll help your body stay regulated while we navigate this moment together."

*Non-verbal script:* Move calmly between infants in conflict. Use a soothing voice tone while physically creating safe space. Offer alternative sensory objects to redirect interest. Demonstrate turn-taking through simple, exaggerated actions. Use animated facial expressions to reinforce successful sharing moments.

*Low-resource adaptation:* Your body remains the primary resource—voice, touch, facial expressions, and demonstrative actions require no materials.

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* Involve multiple children in shared sensory experiences rather than emphasizing parallel play, reinforcing early patterns of collective enjoyment.

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which redirection strategies were most effective? (2) How quickly did co-regulation lead to calming? (3) What early signs of social interest were observed after the conflict?

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking and symbolic resolutions to conflicts that feel mysterious and overwhelming.*

"I see you and [friend] are having a tricky moment over the toy. Sometimes friends have different wishes at the same time, and that feels like a puzzle for our hearts. Could we use our magic sharing wand (an ordinary object imbued with meaning) to help us? When the wand touches the toy, it fills it with enough sharing magic for both friends. Should we try a friendship spell together? 'One, two, three, this toy is big enough for you and me!'"

*Follow-up:* "The sharing magic worked! Should we draw a picture of you and your friend sharing to remind us of the magic we created?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's use our special sharing words to solve this puzzle. When we say 'abracadabra, friends share together,' the toy becomes special enough for both of you. Can you be the magic word keeper?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "In our community, we have ancient wisdom about how friends share together. Let's use our special family/community sharing ceremony that has helped children become good friends for generations."

*Technology adaptation:* "Should we set the sharing timer on our device? It has special sharing music that reminds everyone when it's time to pass the toy to our friend."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which magical/ritual elements facilitated sharing? (2) How independently did the children apply the symbolic resolution? (3) What language did the child use to describe the conflict resolution?

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need to feel powerful and acknowledged while learning to channel their competitive impulses constructively.*

"Wow, you both really want that [toy/role/position]! I can see how strong your feelings are about this. Strong people know lots of ways to solve problems with other strong people. You could take turns being the leader of the game, or create a brand new game where you both get to use your special powers. What powerful solution could you create? Champions know that the strongest move is finding a way for everyone to use their powers."

*Follow-up:* "You just showed how truly powerful you are by finding a solution! That takes real strength."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Show me how mighty problem-solvers handle this! What powerful solution can you create? The strongest leaders know how to make plans where everyone gets to use their powers."

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our community honors those who use their strength to make peace. The most respected warriors in our stories knew how to find solutions where everyone's strength was respected. How can you be like those honored leaders?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use the conflict superhero app that shows different power moves for solving friendship problems? Or would you rather create your own mighty solution right now?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What power-based language motivated cooperation? (2) Which resolution strategy did the child select? (3) How was strength/power reframed in the conflict resolution process?

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear rules for fair interaction and proper procedures for resolving conflicts.*

"It looks like there's a disagreement between you and [friend]. In our classroom/family, we follow specific steps to solve problems fairly. First, each person gets to explain their side while the other listens without interrupting. Then together you look for a solution that follows our rules of fairness. Would you like to go first or second in explaining? Remember, proper problem-solving means listening carefully and then finding a solution that follows our rules."

*Follow-up:* "You followed our conflict resolution steps very responsibly. That's exactly the right way to handle disagreements."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's use our three proper steps for solving disagreements: 1) Each person speaks while the other listens, 2) Both identify the issue clearly, 3) Find a fair solution together. Which step should we start with?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our community has traditional steps for restoring harmony when there's a disagreement. These steps have helped our people maintain proper relationships for generations. Let's honor our traditions by following these steps correctly."

*Technology adaptation:* "We could use the conflict resolution app that guides you through each step of proper problem-solving. It has a timer for speaking turns and suggestion prompts for fair solutions."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How well did the child follow the sequential steps? (2) What language of fairness did they use? (3) How independently did they apply the procedure in subsequent conflicts?

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic approaches to conflicts that help them achieve their goals while navigating social dynamics effectively.*

"This conflict with [peer] seems to be creating an obstacle to what you're trying to accomplish. What outcome would be most beneficial here? Instead of seeing this as just a problem, how might you approach it as a strategic challenge? What approach would be most effective in this situation? Sometimes the most successful strategy involves finding a solution where both people get some of what they want. What creative options might work here?"

*Follow-up:* "The strategy you developed for resolving this showed real skill in problem-solving and getting results."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "What's your desired outcome in this situation? What strategy would be most effective in achieving that goal? How might you negotiate a solution that offers benefits to both parties?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Strategic leadership in our community involves finding solutions that advance both personal goals and group harmony. What approach would demonstrate the kind of leadership our community values? How might you position yourself as an effective problem-solver while strengthening the group?"

*Technology adaptation:* "There are digital negotiation frameworks that outline win-win strategies for different conflict types. Would reviewing those strategies help you develop an effective approach to this situation?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What strategic reasoning did the adolescent apply? (2) How outcome-focused was their approach? (3) What negotiation skills were demonstrated in the resolution process?

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need to explore the emotional and social complexity of conflicts, with emphasis on mutual understanding and inclusive solutions.*

"Conflicts like this one with [peer] often have multiple layers and perspectives. How are you feeling about what happened? What do you think might be going on for them? Sometimes when we explore the underlying needs and feelings on all sides, new possibilities emerge. What might a resolution look like that honors everyone involved? How could this conflict actually strengthen your connection if you work through it thoughtfully?"

*Follow-up:* "The way you considered multiple perspectives and found a solution that worked for everyone shows real emotional intelligence."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's explore the different feelings and perspectives in this conflict. What needs might each person have beneath the surface? What resolution would create understanding and connection for everyone involved?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "The harmony of our community depends on understanding everyone's experiences. Our tradition values those who can listen deeply to all voices and find paths that restore connection. How might you help create a resolution that strengthens our collective bonds?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The empathy mapping app might help visualize the different perspectives and feelings involved. Digital tools sometimes help us organize complex social dynamics in helpful ways."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How readily did the adolescent consider multiple perspectives? (2) What emotional insights emerged during the discussion? (3) How did empathy influence the conflict resolution approach?# Spiral Scripts: Stage-Aligned Language for Common Parenting Moments

Responding effectively to children during challenging moments requires language that resonates with their developmental stage. These **Spiral Scripts** provide ready-to-use, stage-aligned responses for common parenting and teaching scenarios, helping adults communicate in ways that children can truly hear and integrate. By matching your language to a child's **Spiral Dynamics** stage, you can transform difficult moments into opportunities for connection and growth.

## The Power of Stage-Aligned Communication

When a child is experiencing a challenging moment—whether a tantrum, disappointment, conflict, or transition—their ability to process information becomes even more stage-dependent than usual. Language that might work beautifully for a **Blue**-stage child focused on rules and order can completely miss a **Purple**-stage child who needs magical thinking and ritual to make sense of their experience.

These scripts are designed to:

- Provide immediate, practical language for common challenging scenarios
- Align communication with the child's developmental stage for greater resonance
- Support healthy navigation of **stage transitions** and **stage-mixing**
- Help adults respond thoughtfully rather than reactively during difficult moments
- Create opportunities for developmental growth within everyday challenges

Remember that these scripts are starting points, not rigid formulas. The most effective communication always adjusts to the specific child, relationship, and situation. Observe how children respond, and adapt your approach accordingly.

## How to Use These Scripts

1. **Identify the child's primary stage** using the **Child Stage Quiz** or by observing their typical behaviors and needs
2. **Recognize the scenario** that matches your current situation
3. **Review the stage-aligned script** for that scenario
4. **Adapt the language** to your personal style and the specific circumstances
5. **Deliver with authenticity**, maintaining connection through tone and body language
6. **Observe the response** and adjust as needed

The most effective scripts are delivered with genuine connection, appropriate pacing, and attunement to the child's emotional state. Even perfect words fall flat when rushed or delivered without warmth and presence.

## Scripts for Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Handling a Tantrum or Emotional Outburst

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking, ritual, and symbolic reassurance to process big emotions that feel overwhelming and mysterious to them.*

"I see your body is having really big feelings right now. Sometimes feelings can feel like wild weather inside us—like a storm that feels scary. Let's find our special calm-down spot where the storm can't get us. Would you like to hold our special calming stone while we take some dragon breaths together? Remember how we breathe fire out slowly like our friend from the story? The storm always passes, and I'll stay right here with you until it does."

*Follow-up when calm: "What color was your storm? Should we draw a picture of it going away? Let's create a special spell to keep in our pocket for next time the storm comes."*

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need acknowledgment of their power and autonomy while still receiving guidance to channel their strong emotions.*

"Wow, those are some powerful feelings you're showing! Your body looks super strong right now. You get to have big feelings—everyone does—but you also get to be the boss of how you show them. Would you rather stomp those feelings out like a dinosaur over here, or punch them into this pillow like a superhero? You're strong enough to handle these feelings, and I'm right here while you show me how you can take charge of them your way."

*Follow-up when calm: "You found a way to be the boss of those big feelings. What worked best? What power move might work even better next time?"*

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear structures, rules about appropriate expression, and proper procedures for handling emotions.*

"I understand you're feeling upset, and it's okay to have those feelings. There are right ways and not-so-right ways to show them. Taking three deep breaths is step one of our family upset plan. Then we use our words to explain the problem clearly. Would you like to write it down first or tell me directly? Remember, in our family we talk about solutions after we've calmed our bodies down. What's the next step in our plan that you could use right now?"

*Follow-up when calm: "You followed our steps for handling upset feelings. Which step helped the most? Is there anything we should add to our plan for next time?"*

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic approaches to managing emotions and achieving their goals, even during upsets.*

"I see you're really frustrated right now. What outcome are you trying to achieve in this situation? Let's think strategically about this—how effective is this emotional response likely to be in getting you toward your goal? What approach might work better? You're skilled at finding solutions—what strategy could you try now that might be more successful? I'm here to help you think this through if you want another perspective."

*Follow-up when calm: "What did you learn from this situation that you might apply next time? What strategy worked or might work better?"*

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need acknowledgment of the social and emotional complexity of situations, with emphasis on everyone's feelings and perspectives.*

"It seems like there's a lot coming up for you emotionally right now, and that's completely valid. Everyone's feelings matter, including yours. Would it help to talk through what you're experiencing and how this situation is affecting you? I wonder how others involved might be feeling too. When you're ready, we could explore different perspectives together and think about how to honor everyone's needs, including your own. What support would feel most helpful right now?"

*Follow-up when calm: "How did the emotions provide important information about what matters to you? How might understanding everyone's perspectives help in similar situations?"*

**Yellow Stage (Rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need acknowledgment of systemic patterns and contextual complexity, with space for integrative thinking that transcends either/or positions.*

"I notice you're experiencing a strong emotional response in this situation. I'm curious about what patterns or systems you see operating here that might be triggering this reaction. From what contextual perspective does this make the most sense to you? Emotions often signal important information about system dynamics that our cognitive mind hasn't fully processed yet. What multiple perspectives might help illuminate what's happening here? How might this emotional response be serving an important function within the larger context?"

*Follow-up when calm: "What insights emerged from navigating that emotional experience? How might this pattern connect to other systems or contexts in your life?"*

### Scenario 2: Setting Boundaries and Limits

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking and ritual to understand and accept boundaries that feel arbitrary to them.*

"In our family/classroom, we have a special rule about [touching gently/staying nearby/using inside voices]. This magical rule keeps everyone safe and happy, just like walls keep our house cozy and safe from the weather. Your job is to be the special guardian of this rule! Should we create a special hand signal to remind us about our gentle touches? When we follow this special rule, it's like we're all protected by an invisible shield of kindness!"

*Reinforcement: "I notice you being an amazing guardian of our gentle-touch rule! Your magical shield of kindness is super strong today!"*

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need to feel powerful even within necessary limits, with acknowledgment of their strength and autonomy.*

"You have so much amazing energy and strength! And strong people get to make choices about how they use their power. You can choose to use your strength to [move quickly outside instead of inside/use strong words instead of hitting/etc.]. Powerful people know where the boundaries are—that's what makes them truly strong. Which powerful choice will you make right now? I know you can handle this boundary because you're developing great strength."

*Reinforcement: "You just showed how powerful you really are by making a strong choice about how to use your energy!"*

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear rules with logical reasons, emphasizing proper behavior and responsibility.*

"In our family/classroom, we have an important rule about [specific boundary]. This rule exists because [clear reason tied to order/safety/respect]. When everyone follows this rule, things work well for the whole group. Part of growing up is learning to follow important rules even when we might not feel like it. I know you're responsible enough to do the right thing here. What's the proper choice in this situation?"

*Reinforcement: "You showed real responsibility by following our important rule. That's what helps our family/classroom function properly."*

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic reasoning for boundaries, with emphasis on how boundaries serve their personal goals and success.*

"I understand you want [what they're pushing for]. Let's discuss this boundary of [specific limit] and why it exists. How might this boundary actually help you achieve your longer-term goals? Sometimes short-term limitations create space for bigger successes later. What would a strategic approach to this situation look like? I'm open to hearing your perspective on how we might make this work effectively for everyone involved."

*Reinforcement: "The way you thought strategically about this boundary and found a workable solution shows real maturity and foresight."*

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need collaborative approaches to boundaries that honor everyone's perspectives and feelings.*

"This boundary around [specific limit] affects everyone in our family/group. I'd like to understand your perspective on it, and I'd also like to share how I see it. Everyone's needs matter here. How might we find an approach that respects both your desire for [what they want] and the need for [reason for boundary]? Perhaps we can explore a solution together that honors multiple perspectives and still maintains necessary boundaries."

*Reinforcement: "The way you considered everyone's needs while working within this boundary shows real emotional intelligence and care for the community."*

**Yellow Stage (Rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need flexible, context-sensitive boundaries that acknowledge complexity and adaptive principles rather than rigid rules.*

"I see we're navigating this boundary around [specific limit]. I'm curious about the underlying principles at play here rather than just the surface rule. What functions does this boundary serve in different contexts? When might it be most relevant, and when might a different approach better serve the deeper principles? I'm open to examining this from multiple perspectives and considering adaptive approaches based on context rather than applying a one-size-fits-all solution. What functional alternatives might address the core needs while respecting the complexity of the situation?"

*Reinforcement: "Your ability to see beyond the simple boundary to the underlying principles and adapt based on context shows remarkable integrative thinking."*

### Scenario 3: Navigating Peer Conflicts

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking and symbolic resolutions to conflicts that feel mysterious and overwhelming.*

"I see you and [friend] are having a tricky moment over the toy. Sometimes friends have different wishes at the same time, and that feels like a puzzle for our hearts. Could we use our magic sharing wand (an ordinary object imbued with meaning) to help us? When the wand touches the toy, it fills it with enough sharing magic for both friends. Should we try a friendship spell together? 'One, two, three, this toy is big enough for you and me!'"

*Follow-up: "The sharing magic worked! Should we draw a picture of you and your friend sharing to remind us of the magic we created?"*

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need to feel powerful and acknowledged while learning to channel their competitive impulses constructively.*

"Wow, you both really want that [toy/role/position]! I can see how strong your feelings are about this. Strong people know lots of ways to solve problems with other strong people. You could take turns being the leader of the game, or create a brand new game where you both get to use your special powers. What powerful solution could you create? Champions know that the strongest move is finding a way for everyone to use their powers."

*Follow-up: "You just showed how truly powerful you are by finding a solution! That takes real strength."*

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear rules for fair interaction and proper procedures for resolving conflicts.*

"It looks like there's a disagreement between you and [friend]. In our classroom/family, we follow specific steps to solve problems fairly. First, each person gets to explain their side while the other listens without interrupting. Then together you look for a solution that follows our rules of fairness. Would you like to go first or second in explaining? Remember, proper problem-solving means listening carefully and then finding a solution that follows our rules."

*Follow-up: "You followed our conflict resolution steps very responsibly. That's exactly the right way to handle disagreements."*

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic approaches to conflicts that help them achieve their goals while navigating social dynamics effectively.*

"This conflict with [peer] seems to be creating an obstacle to what you're trying to accomplish. What outcome would be most beneficial here? Instead of seeing this as just a problem, how might you approach it as a strategic challenge? What approach would be most effective in this situation? Sometimes the most successful strategy involves finding a solution where both people get some of what they want. What creative options might work here?"

*Follow-up: "The strategy you developed for resolving this showed real skill in problem-solving and getting results."*

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need to explore the emotional and social complexity of conflicts, with emphasis on mutual understanding and inclusive solutions.*

"Conflicts like this one with [peer] often have multiple layers and perspectives. How are you feeling about what happened? What do you think might be going on for them? Sometimes when we explore the underlying needs and feelings on all sides, new possibilities emerge. What might a resolution look like that honors everyone involved? How could this conflict actually strengthen your connection if you work through it thoughtfully?"

*Follow-up: "The way you considered multiple perspectives and found a solution that worked for everyone shows real emotional intelligence."*

**Yellow Stage (Rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need to recognize patterns within conflicts, see multiple valid perspectives simultaneously, and develop adaptive, contextual approaches to resolution.*

"This conflict with [peer] seems to reflect some interesting patterns. I'm curious how you see this situation from multiple perspectives simultaneously. What different 'truths' might be operating here that appear contradictory but could all be valid in different ways? What underlying systems or contexts might be influencing how this conflict has emerged? Rather than seeking a single 'right' solution, what adaptive approach might address the deeper patterns at play? How might this conflict actually reveal something important about the larger systems you're both navigating?"

*Follow-up: "Your ability to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously and address the underlying patterns rather than just the surface conflict shows remarkable integrative thinking."*

### Scenario 4: Supporting During Transitions and Changes

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking, ritual, and symbolic continuity to navigate changes that feel disruptive to their sense of safety.*

"Soon we'll be saying goodbye to [this home/classroom/situation] and hello to our new one. Changes can feel like a big mystery in our hearts. Let's create a special goodbye ceremony with [special object] to carry all our favorite memories. And then we'll make a special hello ceremony to welcome the new adventures waiting for us. Our special [comfort object] will come with us so we always have a piece of magic from before. Should we make a magic protection charm to keep us brave during our change journey?"

*Follow-up: "Our magic charm is working! It brought all our love from our old [place] to our new one. Shall we add new magic to it from this special place too?"*

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need to feel powerful and in control during transitions that might otherwise make them feel vulnerable.*

"A big change is coming with our move to [new situation]. Changes give us a chance to show how strong and brave we can be! You'll get to be an explorer discovering a new territory. What's one thing you want to be in charge of in our new [home/school/situation]? Brave explorers sometimes feel nervous too, but they use their super powers to face new adventures. What special power will help you most during this change?"

*Follow-up: "You used your explorer strength during that change! What new territory have you claimed in our new [situation]?"*

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear structures, predictable procedures, and assurance of proper order during transitions.*

"We're preparing for our transition to [new situation]. I know changes can feel uncomfortable when we're used to how things are supposed to be. Let's create a clear plan with steps for how this transition will work. What questions do you have about the rules and expectations in our new [situation]? Which of our important routines can we maintain even though other things will change? Having a proper plan helps make sure transitions go smoothly."

*Follow-up: "You followed our transition plan very responsibly. That's exactly how successful changes are supposed to happen."*

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need to see transitions as strategic opportunities with potential benefits and clear paths to success.*

What specific plan would make this change work best for what you want to accomplish?"

*Follow-up: "The strategy you developed for handling this transition shows real skill in turning change into opportunity."*

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need to process the social and emotional complexities of transitions, with emphasis on community impacts and diverse experiences.*

"As we prepare for this transition to [new situation], different people in our family/group are probably experiencing it in different ways. How are you feeling about this change? What do you think others might be experiencing? Times of change often bring up important emotions that deserve space and acknowledgment. How might we support each other through this transition in ways that honor everyone's experience? What values do you want to bring with you into this new chapter?"

*Follow-up: "The way you've considered how this change affects everyone shows real emotional wisdom and care for our community."*

**Yellow Stage (Rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need to perceive transitions as natural adaptive processes within larger systems, with opportunities for integrative growth and pattern recognition.*

"This transition to [new situation] represents an interesting inflection point in multiple systems simultaneously. I'm curious about the patterns you're noticing as this change unfolds. How do you see various elements adapting in different ways? What appears to be ending, and what seems to be emerging? Rather than seeing this as simply a change from A to B, how might it represent an evolution in the complex systems you're part of? What principles or approaches feel most appropriate for navigating this transition effectively, recognizing that different contexts might call for different adaptations?"

*Follow-up: "Your ability to perceive the larger patterns in this transition while adaptively responding to specific contexts shows remarkable systemic intelligence."*

### Scenario 5: Helping Process Disappointment and Failure

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Purple-stage children need magical thinking and ritual to process disappointments that feel mysterious and overwhelming.*

"Your heart is feeling sad because you didn't get to [desired outcome]. Sad feelings can feel like a rain cloud over our sun. Let's hold our special comfort stone and let it catch all your sad raindrops. Sometimes the world has mysteries we don't understand, like why we can't always have what we wish for. Should we do our special sadness ceremony? We can draw our sad feelings and then fold the paper into a boat to sail them away. Remember, after rain clouds, rainbows come to bring magic back to our hearts."

*Follow-up: "Look how your rainbow is starting to peek out! Should we make a wish on it for tomorrow?"*

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Red-stage children need to feel powerful even in the face of disappointment, with opportunities to exert control over their response.*

"That didn't go the way you wanted, and that feels really frustrating! Even the strongest heroes sometimes don't get what they want or don't succeed on the first try. But powerful people get to choose how they respond when things don't go their way. You could stomp out your disappointed feelings, create a brand new plan of attack, or use your mighty voice to tell me exactly how you feel. What powerful choice do you want to make about these feelings?"

*Follow-up: "You showed real power in how you handled that disappointment. That's what makes someone truly strong!"*

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Blue-stage children need clear explanations, proper procedures for handling setbacks, and assurance that disappointment is a normal part of the proper order.*

"I can see you're disappointed about [situation]. Everyone experiences disappointment sometimes—it's a normal part of life, even when we do everything right.

Finally, we make a plan for moving forward in the right way. Which of these steps would help you most right now?"

*Follow-up: "You handled that disappointment very maturely by following the proper steps. That shows real responsibility."*

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Orange-stage adolescents need strategic approaches to setbacks that reframe them as learning opportunities and stepping stones to future success.*

"This outcome isn't what you were aiming for, and that's understandably frustrating. The most successful people actually use setbacks as valuable data for improving their strategies. What specific information can you gather from this experience that might help you succeed next time? How might you adjust your approach? Many innovations and breakthroughs actually come from initial failures. What opportunity might this disappointment be creating?"

*Follow-up: "The way you analyzed this setback and created a new strategy shows the kind of thinking that leads to long-term success."*

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Green-stage adolescents need to explore the emotional complexity of disappointment with emphasis on self-compassion and shared human experience.*

"This disappointment seems significant, and all your feelings about it are completely valid. Many people experience similar feelings when facing setbacks—it's part of our shared human experience. How are you making meaning of what happened? Sometimes our most difficult experiences connect us more deeply to ourselves and others. What would self-compassion look like in this situation? What support would feel most helpful as you process these feelings?"

*Follow-up: "The way you've reflected on this experience with both emotional honesty and compassion shows real emotional intelligence."*

**Yellow Stage (Rare in adolescence)**:

*Understanding their needs: Yellow-stage adolescents need to recognize how disappointment fits into larger patterns of growth and adaptation, seeing multiple perspectives on failure simultaneously.*

"This outcome differs from what you'd anticipated. I'm curious about how you're seeing this disappointment from multiple perspectives. What patterns might this experience be revealing about the larger systems or contexts involved? How might this apparent setback actually serve an adaptive function in your broader development? What seems most interesting or revealing about your response to this situation? Rather than seeing this simply as success or failure, what more nuanced and context-dependent understanding might emerge? What principles for moving forward seem most aligned with the complexity of what you've experienced?"

*Follow-up: "Your ability to see this disappointment as information within a larger pattern while adapting your approach based on what you've learned demonstrates remarkable integrative thinking."*

## Scripts for Stage Transitions and Stage-Mixing

Children often show signs of multiple stages simultaneously or move between stages depending on context, stress level, or developmental shifts. These scripts help navigate the complexity of **stage transitions** and **stage-mixing**.

### Purple-to-Red Transition

*Understanding the shift: The child is moving from magical thinking and ritual toward power exploration and self-assertion.*

**When regression to Purple occurs during stress:**

"I notice big changes can sometimes make us want our special rituals again. It's okay to need both your magical [comfort object/ritual] AND to be strong and powerful. Let's do our special comfort ritual first, and then you can show me how bravely you can handle this situation. Your magic and your strength can work together!"

*Understanding the shift: The adolescent is moving from community values and empathy toward systemic thinking and flexible adaptation across contexts.*

**When regression to Green occurs during stress:**

"During complex challenges, sometimes we focus primarily on honoring everyone's perspectives and feelings. It's natural to care deeply about inclusion AND to recognize larger patterns that might require adaptive responses. Let's acknowledge the emotional and community aspects here, while also exploring the systemic patterns that might offer a more integrative understanding."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Honoring everyone's experience is essential AND seeing the larger patterns helps us find more adaptive solutions. What emotional needs are present, and what systemic factors might be influencing the situation?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The group feedback platform can capture everyone's perspectives, while the systems mapping tool might help us visualize the larger patterns at play across contexts."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What balance of community focus and systems awareness worked best? (2) How did the adolescent integrate empathic understanding with pattern recognition?

**When new Yellow behaviors emerge:**

"I notice you're starting to see patterns across different perspectives and situations that others might miss! You're developing more integrative thinking while still maintaining your empathy and care for community. It's powerful to combine compassion AND systemic awareness. I appreciate how you're able to adapt your approach based on context rather than applying one solution to every situation."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "You're recognizing patterns that connect different perspectives! How might understanding these systems help us create approaches that adapt to different contexts while still honoring everyone's needs?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The adaptive systems modeling tool might help visualize how different approaches could work in varied contexts while still maintaining core values across situations."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which systemic patterns did the adolescent identify across contexts? (2) How did the adolescent maintain empathic connection while developing contextual flexibility?

### Yellow-to-Turquoise Transition

*Understanding the shift: The individual is moving from systemic thinking and contextual adaptation toward holistic awareness and evolutionary understanding.*

**When regression to Yellow occurs during stress:**

"Complex situations sometimes pull us toward analyzing systems and patterns. It's valuable to understand these interconnections AND to sense the holistic field they exist within. Let's acknowledge the systemic dynamics at play, while also attending to the intuitive knowing that might emerge when we hold the whole rather than just the parts."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Seeing the interconnected patterns is insightful AND there may be a deeper wholeness that transcends analytical understanding. What systems are at play, and what intuitive knowing emerges when you attend to the whole?"

*Technology adaptation:* "Systems modeling tools have value for mapping complex relationships, though they're limited in capturing the holistic field. Perhaps we can use digital visualization as one lens while maintaining awareness of what lies beyond it."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What balance of systems analysis and holistic awareness worked best? (2) How did the individual integrate analytical understanding with intuitive knowing?

**When new Turquoise awareness emerges:**

"I notice you're perceiving connections that transcend conventional systems thinking! You're developing a more holistic awareness while still maintaining your ability to recognize patterns and contexts. There's something powerful about holding both the analytic understanding of systems AND the direct perception of wholeness. I appreciate how you're able to move fluidly between detailed analysis and holistic awareness."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "You're sensing the wholeness that contains all these patterns! How might this holistic awareness inform how we approach complex situations while still honoring the detailed understanding of systems?"

*Technology adaptation:* "While digital tools have clear limitations in capturing holistic awareness, perhaps the immersive visualization environment might offer one window into how different dimensions interconnect beyond conventional analysis."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) In what contexts did holistic awareness emerge most clearly? (2) How did the individual integrate systems understanding with perception of wholeness? moving from achievement and strategy toward community values and empathy.*

**When regression to Orange occurs during stress:**

"In challenging situations, sometimes we focus most on finding the most effective strategy. It's natural to want clear solutions AND to care about how everyone is affected. Let's think about what would work effectively here, while also considering how different people might experience that approach."

**When new Green behaviors emerge:**

"I notice you're becoming more aware of how different people experience situations differently! You're developing deeper empathy while still maintaining your ability to find effective solutions. It's powerful to combine strategic thinking AND awareness of everyone's needs. How might we find an approach that accomplishes our goals while honoring diverse perspectives?"

### Green-to-Yellow Transition

*Understanding the shift: The adolescent is moving from community values and empathy toward systemic thinking and flexible adaptation across contexts.*

**When regression to Green occurs during stress:**

"During complex challenges, sometimes we focus primarily on honoring everyone's perspectives and feelings. It's natural to care deeply about inclusion AND to recognize larger patterns that might require adaptive responses. Let's acknowledge the emotional and community aspects here, while also exploring the systemic patterns that might offer a more integrative understanding."

**When new Yellow behaviors emerge:**

"I notice you're starting to see patterns across different perspectives and situations that others might miss! You're developing more integrative thinking while still maintaining your empathy and care for community. It's powerful to combine compassion AND systemic awareness. I appreciate how you're able to adapt your approach based on context rather than applying one solution to every situation."

## Scripts for Major Life Events

Major transitions such as moves, school changes, family restructuring, losses, or community challenges require specially adapted language. These scripts help children process significant changes through their developmental lens.

### Moving to a New Home

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

"Our family is going on a special journey to a new home. Our hearts might feel mixed up because we love our special places here. We'll take our special [comfort objects] with us, and they'll help bring the magic from this home to our new one. Should we create a special good-bye ceremony for each room to thank it for keeping us safe? And then we'll make a special hello ceremony to welcome the new rooms into our hearts. The love in our family is magic that comes with us wherever we go."

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

"Our family will be moving to a new home on [date], and I know changes to our normal routine can feel uncomfortable. Here's what we can expect during this transition: [outline clear steps]. Some important things will stay the same, like our family rules and bedtime routine, even though our location will change. What questions do you have about how things will work in our new home? Let's make a proper plan together for how we'll organize your room in the new house."

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

"As we prepare for this move, I imagine everyone in our family has different feelings about it. How are you feeling about leaving this place and what it has meant to you? Your connection to your friends and this community is important, and we want to honor that. How might we create meaningful closure before we leave, and what would help you build connections in our new community? What values from our time here do you want to bring with you to our new home?"

### Parental Separation/Divorce

**Red Stage (4-8 years)**:

"Mom and Dad have made a big decision about our family. We won't all be living together in the same house anymore. This isn't because of anything you did—grown-ups sometimes need to make powerful changes. You might have big feelings about this, and that's okay—all your feelings are important and allowed. What you need to know for sure is that your power to be loved by both of us stays super strong. You'll have two special homes now, and you get to help make some choices about how we set up your spaces."

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

"I need to talk with you about an important change in our family structure. Mom and Dad have decided to separate and live in different homes. I know this will impact your life in significant ways. I'd like to discuss how we can create arrangements that will work effectively for your needs during this transition. You'll have input into certain aspects of the plan, though some decisions will need to be made by the adults. What questions or concerns do you have about how this will affect your goals and activities?"

**Turquoise perspective for older adolescents with advanced development**:

"As you know, your father and I have decided to end our marriage. While this represents a structural change in our family system, the deeper connections between us all remain. Each relationship will continue to evolve in its own way. I know you have the wisdom to see beyond simple explanations—relationships contain multiple truths simultaneously. As we move through this transition, what might help you integrate this experience in a way that honors both the challenge and the opportunity for growth it presents for our whole family system?"

### Death of a Loved One

**Purple Stage (2-6 years)**:

"Something very sad has happened. [Person] has died, which means their body stopped working and they can't come back. It's not like sleeping—when we sleep, our body still works. This is a different kind of goodbye. Our hearts might feel very achy with missing them. Some people believe that when someone dies, their love becomes like magic that stays in our hearts forever. We can create a special remembering place with pictures and things that help us feel close to them. Would you like to draw a picture about a special time with [person] that we can put in our remembering place?"

**Blue Stage (6-12 years)**:

"I need to tell you some difficult news. [Person] has died. Death is a natural part of life, though it doesn't happen in the same way or at the same time for everyone. When someone dies, their body stops functioning completely, and they don't come back to life. Many people have different beliefs about what happens after death, and it's okay to have questions about this. In our family, we believe [share family beliefs or acknowledge different perspectives]. It's completely normal and proper to have many feelings about this loss. Here's what will happen next: [explain funeral or memorial plans with clear steps]."

**Orange Stage (10-16 years)**:

"I have difficult news to share with you. [Person] has died [provide relevant details if appropriate]. I know this will impact you significantly, and there's no single right way to respond to loss. Everyone processes grief differently and on their own timeline. What questions do you have about what happened or what comes next? As you process this, what support would be most helpful for you? While we can't change this outcome, we can think about meaningful ways to honor [person's] impact on our lives."

**Green Stage (14-18 years)**:

"I need to share some difficult news with you. [Person] has died. I imagine this might bring up many complex feelings, all of which are completely valid. Each person in our family/community will likely experience this loss differently, and all those experiences deserve space and respect. How are you feeling about this news? As we move through this together, we can create space for everyone's grief process while supporting each other. What might help you feel connected both to [person's] memory and to our community during this time? How might we honor both our individual and collective experience of this loss?"

**Yellow Stage (Rare in adolescence)**:

"I have difficult news to share. [Person] has died. Death represents one of those profound transitions that touches multiple dimensions of our experience simultaneously. I'm curious about what's arising for you as you take in this news. There are many ways to understand and respond to death, all valid from different perspectives—from the biological process, to the psychological experience, to the many cultural and spiritual frameworks humans have developed. How are you making sense of this transition within your own understanding? What patterns or insights emerge for you about life, death, and our interconnections? How might different responses or rituals serve different functions during this time of transition?"

## Scripts for Neurodivergent Children 

Children with neurodevelopmental differences may require adapted language that honors both their developmental stage and their unique cognitive, sensory, and emotional processing styles.

### For Autistic Children

**Beige Stage with Autism (0-2 years)**:

*Understanding their needs: Beige-stage autistic infants may have heightened sensory sensitivities, need more predictable patterns, and benefit from clear sensory signals.*

*Non-verbal script:* Use slow, predictable movements when approaching. Maintain consistent pressure when touching—either very light or moderately firm based on the child's preference, avoiding light unpredictable touch. Keep facial expressions clear and somewhat exaggerated. Create predictable sensory routines with clear beginnings and endings.

*Low-resource adaptation:* Use simple household items with consistent sensory properties (smooth cloth, firm cushion) rather than varied textures. Keep environmental sounds at consistent levels.

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* Coordinate consistent handling patterns among all family members, creating a unified sensory environment across caregivers.

*Technology adaptation:* If available, use simple audio recordings with consistent sounds rather than variable music.

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which sensory inputs were calming vs. alerting? (2) What predictable patterns created the most regulation? (3) How did the infant communicate sensory preferences?

**Purple Stage with Autism (2-6 years)**:

*Adaptations: More concrete language, sensory considerations, and predictable rituals without sacrificing the magical thinking that serves this stage.*

"It's time for our special goodbye-to-playground ritual. First, we'll wave to the swings three times. Next, we'll take three deep dragon breaths. Then we'll walk to the car. The playground will stay here waiting for us to come back next Tuesday. Would you like to hold our special transition stone during our goodbye ritual? The bumpy side can help your fingers know we're doing our leaving routine."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Our playground goodbye has three steps. First wave. Then breathe. Then walk to car. The playground stays here until we come back Tuesday. Would you like to rub this smooth leaf while we do our goodbye steps?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our family has a special way to say goodbye to places. Everyone does the same steps together: wave, breathe, walk. When we all do the steps together, it helps everyone feel safe about leaving. The playground will wait for our whole family to return."

*Technology adaptation:* "Would you like to use the visual schedule app that shows our three goodbye steps with pictures? When each step is done, you can press the button to hear the special sound."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which elements of predictability were most regulating? (2) What sensory supports facilitated transitions? (3) How independently did the child reference or initiate the routine?

**Blue Stage with Autism (6-12 years)**:

*Adaptations: Clear, specific expectations, visual supports, and concrete language while honoring the need for rules and order.*

"In five minutes, math time will end and science time will begin. Here's our visual schedule showing exactly what will happen: 1) Put math materials in the blue bin, 2) Take a stretch break, 3) Get science notebook from the shelf, 4) Sit at the lab table. The rules for science class are posted on the green chart. Would you like to be the materials monitor today? That job means following the three steps on this card to distribute the correct materials to each group."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Math time ends in five minutes when I show this card. Science time has four steps: 1) Math away, 2) Stretch, 3) Get notebook, 4) Sit at lab table. The science rules are the same as yesterday. Would you like to be in charge of giving out the materials by following these three steps?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our class will transition from math to science in five minutes. Everyone in our community has responsibilities to help this change go smoothly. Your special role could be materials monitor, which helps our whole group succeed. Here are the exact steps that this important job requires."

*Technology adaptation:* "The timer app shows five minutes until we switch subjects. Would you like to use the digital schedule that shows each transition step with a checkmark option? The materials distribution app can guide you through each step of being the monitor."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which visual supports were most effective? (2) How did concrete step instructions affect task completion? (3) What role structures supported successful participation?

**Orange Stage with Autism (10-16 years)**:

*Adaptations: Focus on logical reasoning, clear parameters for projects, and explicit connection to goals while supporting executive function.*

"For this science project, the objective is to demonstrate how different variables affect plant growth. Here's a flowchart showing the exact steps in the experimental process and how they connect to your final presentation. I've broken the project into five specific milestones with clear deadlines: 1) Research questions—due Friday, 2) Materials gathering—due Monday, etc. Which part would you like to start with? How might we create a system to help you track your progress on each component?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "This science project has a clear goal: show how variables affect plants. Here's a simple chart with the five exact steps and when each needs to be done. Which specific step would you like to start with? What system would help you remember each deadline?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Our team project will demonstrate how variables affect plant growth. Each person has specific responsibilities that contribute to our group's success. Here's a detailed chart showing how your individual tasks connect to our collective outcome. What organizational system would help you fulfill your important role in our group's work?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The project management app can break this assignment into specific milestones with reminders for each deadline. You can see exactly how each step connects to the final goal and track your progress with the visualization tool."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which organizational frameworks supported independent work? (2) How did explicit goal connections affect motivation? (3) What self-monitoring strategies proved most effective?

### For Children with ADHD

**Red Stage with ADHD (4-8 years)**:

*Adaptations: Brief, energetic language, movement opportunities, and immediate feedback while honoring power needs.*

"Your body needs to move AND we need to keep everyone safe! Power choice time: You can be a jumping superhero in this special square OR a running champion in the outdoor zone. Quick choice—which powerful energy release do you pick? You'll get a strength point each time you remember to use your powers in the right zone. Ready for action in three, two, one, GO!"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Your body has super energy! Quick choice: Be a jumping hero here OR a running champion there? You earn power points for using energy in the right space. Choose now—ready, set, GO!"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "Your powerful energy can help our community when used in the right ways! Our group needs a movement leader: You can lead jumping exercises in this space OR organize running activities in that space. Your strength helps everyone when channeled properly. Which leadership role do you choose?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The movement zone app has a timer and point tracker for your energy bursts! Quick choice: Jumping hero mode OR running champion mode? The app will count your power points when you use the right zone. Three-second decision time—GO!"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) Which movement options were most regulating? (2) How did brief, action-oriented language affect attention? (3) What immediate feedback systems were most motivating?

**Orange Stage with ADHD (10-16 years)**:

*Adaptations: Focus on goals and results rather than process, break tasks into manageable parts, and connect to intrinsic motivation while honoring achievement orientation.*

"Let's hack this homework challenge with a strategic plan designed for your brain's strengths. What's the end goal we need to achieve here? Great—now let's break it into three mini-missions of 10 minutes each, with movement breaks in between. Which approach would be most effective for you to tackle the first section? What reward would make reaching the final goal feel most satisfying to you? Let's track your progress visually so you can see how your strategy is working."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Let's turn this homework into a strategic challenge with a clear win condition. What's the final goal? Now let's create three 10-minute missions with breaks between. Which approach gives you the advantage for mission one? How will you celebrate when you achieve victory?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "This academic challenge requires strategic thinking that could benefit our whole group. What end result would represent success? Let's create a mission plan that uses your unique strengths while contributing to our shared knowledge. How might breaking this into smaller missions with movement opportunities help you contribute most effectively?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The productivity app can gamify this homework with mission objectives, countdown timers, and achievement tracking. You can customize the work/break intervals and see your progress bar advance with each completed section. What reward system would make completion most satisfying?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) What task breakdown approach was most effective? (2) Which motivational frameworks increased persistence? (3) How did movement integration affect focus and completion?

### For Children with Sensory Processing Differences

**Purple Stage with Sensory Processing Differences (2-6 years)**:

*Adaptations: Incorporate sensory awareness into magical thinking, provide advance warning of sensory changes, and create sensory-based rituals.*

"Your body has special magic powers that help you know when things feel just right or not quite right. Your magic touch sensors might feel happier with this soft blanket during story time. Your magic ear powers might need these special earmuffs when we go to the noisy playground. What magic tools does your body need for the next adventure? We can put them in our special sensory treasure chest so they're ready when your body's magic powers send you signals."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Your body has magic feeling powers. It sends special messages about what feels good or too much. What magic helpers does your body want for our next activity? We can keep them in our special place ready for when your body sends messages."

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "In our family/community, each person's body wisdom is special and important. Our ancestors taught us to listen to these magic signals. What sensory wisdom is your body sharing right now? Our family has special tools to honor each person's unique magic powers."

*Technology adaptation:* "The sensory story app lets you create a magical character with special sensory powers just like yours! We can program which sensory tools your character needs for different adventures, and set gentle warnings before sensory changes in the story."

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How effectively did the child identify sensory needs through magical frameworks? (2) Which sensory rituals provided most regulation? (3) What predictability elements supported sensory processing?

**Blue Stage with Sensory Processing Differences (6-12 years)**:

*Adaptations: Create clear rules for sensory management, develop proper procedures for handling sensory challenges, and establish orderly environments.*

"Our bodies have important sensory systems that help us know about our environment. When sensory information feels too strong, there are proper steps we can follow to help our bodies feel regulated again. Here's our sensory regulation chart with the correct procedures: 1) Notice the sensory signal your body is sending, 2) Identify which sense needs support, 3) Choose the appropriate sensory tool from our organized toolkit, 4) Use the tool following the proper steps. Would you like to be in charge of keeping our sensory toolkit properly organized?"

*Low-resource adaptation:* "Our bodies have sensory systems that need proper care. When your body sends signals that something is too much, follow these steps: 1) Notice the feeling, 2) Name which sense needs help, 3) Use the right tool, 4) Return to the activity when ready. What system would help you remember these steps?"

*Cultural adaptation (collectivist):* "In our community, we respect each person's sensory needs as part of maintaining harmony. Our traditional practices include proper ways to support each other's regulation. These time-honored steps help everyone participate comfortably in group activities. What responsibility would you like in helping maintain our sensory respect system?"

*Technology adaptation:* "The sensory management app has a classification system for different sensory inputs and the proper tools for each. The step-by-step guide can walk you through the correct procedure for addressing each type of sensory challenge. Would you like to be responsible for maintaining the digital inventory of our sensory tools?"

*Assessment tracking:* Note in the **Individual Progress Tracker**: (1) How independently did the child identify sensory needs? (2) Which structured responses were most effective? (3) How did organization systems support self-regulation?

## Key Principles for Effective Scripts

As you adapt these scripts to your specific situations, keep these principles in mind:

**Authenticity matters most.** Children respond more to your genuine connection than to perfectly crafted words. Adapt language to fit your natural voice and relationship.

**Developmental alignment creates resonance.** When your words match a child's way of making meaning, they can truly hear and integrate what you're saying.

**Follow the child's lead.** Notice which approaches resonate and which fall flat, and be willing to shift your strategy based on the child's response.

**Honor transitions and mixing.** Most children show elements of multiple stages or move between stages depending on context and stress level. Be flexible in your approach.

**Simplify during stress.** Children often regress during challenging moments. When in doubt, use language from an earlier stage than you might typically use.

**Connect before directing.** Even the most perfectly crafted script fails without emotional connection. Make contact before offering guidance.

**Practice in calm moments.** Review and practice these scripts before you need them so the language becomes more natural in challenging situations.

**Remember cultural context.** Adapt language to honor your family's cultural values and expressions while maintaining developmental alignment.

**Use available resources.** Modify scripts based on what's readily available in your environment—physical objects, natural materials, cultural practices, or technology if appropriate.

**Track effectiveness.** Note which approaches work best for your specific child using the **Individual Progress Tracker** (available on Spiralize.org), building a personalized understanding of effective communication.

**Bridge stage gaps thoughtfully.** When you and your child operate from different developmental stages, use language that creates bridges between your perspectives.

**Consider neurodivergent needs.** Adapt scripts to honor both developmental stage and unique neurological profiles, adjusting sensory, cognitive, and emotional elements as needed.

By meeting children with language that resonates with their developmental stage, you create opportunities for both immediate connection and long-term growth. These scripts offer starting points for the dance of communication that unfolds uniquely within each relationship.

## Assessment and Tracking

To maximize the effectiveness of these scripts and support your child's developmental journey:

1. **Observe and document responses** using the **Individual Progress Tracker** (available on Spiralize.org):
   - Which specific language patterns created the strongest connection?
   - How quickly did the child regulate emotions after using stage-aligned language?
   - What signs of developmental growth appeared after consistent use of these approaches?

2. **Track patterns across contexts**:
   - Do certain scripts work better in particular settings (home, school, public places)?
   - Are there time-of-day patterns in how your child responds to different communication styles?
   - How do responses change during transitions, stress, or growth periods?

3. **Note stage transitions**:
   - What new language patterns is your child beginning to respond to?
   - When do earlier-stage scripts suddenly seem less effective?
   - What stage-mixing patterns are appearing during different activities or emotional states?

4. **Share observations with other caregivers**:
   - Which scripts have proven most effective for specific situations?
   - What developmental patterns has each caregiver noticed?
   - How can communication approaches be consistently applied across relationships?

5. **Review and adjust regularly**:
   - Set a monthly review of which scripts and approaches have been most effective
   - Adjust your communication toolkit based on the child's developmental progress
   - Gradually introduce scripts from the next developmental stage as readiness appears

The **Individual Progress Tracker** provides a structured way to document these observations, helping you build a personalized understanding of your child's unique developmental journey.

## Coral Stage Scripts: The Emergent Horizon

The **Coral** stage represents a rare and speculative developmental stage beyond **Turquoise**, characterized by transcendent awareness, creative sovereignty, and embodied wisdom. While virtually non-existent in children and extremely rare in adults, we include these scripts for developmental completeness and to honor the full spiral of human potential.

**Scenario: Navigating Life Challenges**

*Understanding their needs: Coral-stage individuals need communication that honors transcendent awareness, creative emergence, and sovereign wisdom while remaining grounded in embodied reality.*

"This situation appears to be manifesting as a nexus point where multiple dimensions of reality converge. I'm curious what's emerging through you as you hold this experience in awareness. Beyond conventional understanding of problems and solutions, what creative potential might be seeking expression through this very challenge? What becomes possible when we attend to both the immanent details and the transcendent field from which they arise? I honor your sovereignty in how you navigate this liminal space and the wisdom that may emerge through your embodied presence with what is."

*Follow-up:* "The way you're participating in this emerging reality—neither controlling nor abandoning but creatively engaging—reflects a remarkable integration of sovereignty and surrender."

*Low-resource adaptation:* "What wisdom is emerging through this experience that transcends conventional understandings? What creative potential becomes visible from multiple dimensions of awareness? How might your sovereign presence participate in what's emerging?"

*Cultural adaptation:* "Ancient wisdom traditions across all cultures have recognized these nexus points where new realities seek emergence. How might the deepest wisdom of our lineage inform what's possible here, while remaining open to unprecedented emergence? What sovereign offering might you bring to this evolutionary moment?"

*Assessment tracking:* While standardized tracking is inherently limited for this stage, one might note: (1) What transcendent awareness emerged during the interaction? (2) How was creative sovereignty expressed? (3) What evolutionary perspective informed the engagement?
