# Curriculum Snapshot Template

The **Curriculum Snapshot** is a structured template designed to help educators and parents summarize stage-aligned curriculum plans within the **Spiral-Aware Parenting & Education Guide**. It outlines activities, digital tools, and assessment methods tailored to children’s **Spiral Dynamics** stages (**Beige** to **Green**, with rare **Yellow**, **Turquoise**, and **Coral**) for core subjects (e.g., Language Arts, Mathematics) and supplementary areas (e.g., Social-Emotional Learning, Arts). This tool supports **stage transitions**, **stage-mixing**, and **major life events** (e.g., school transitions, family changes) while ensuring inclusivity for neurodivergent learners and diverse cultural/socioeconomic contexts.

## Purpose

The **Curriculum Snapshot** aims to:
- Provide a concise, actionable summary of stage-specific curriculum plans to align teaching and parenting practices with developmental needs.
- Detail stage-appropriate activities, tools, and assessments to foster engagement, learning, and emotional growth.
- Support **stage transitions**, **stage-mixing**, and **major life events** by offering flexible, adaptable curriculum designs.
- Ensure inclusivity by incorporating adaptations for neurodivergent learners and diverse cultural/socioeconomic contexts.

This tool builds on **Curriculum Transformation** (Section IV), **Teaching Strategies** (Section V.04), **Technology Integration** (Section V), **Pedagogies** (Section III), and **Developmental Signals & Needs** (Section I). It integrates with the **Child Stage Quiz**, **Spiral Curriculum Planner**, **Spiral Technology Planner**, **Spiral Stage Timeline**, and **Individual Progress Tracker** (available on Spiralize.org).

## How to Use the Curriculum Snapshot

1. **Identify Stages**: Use the **Child Stage Quiz** (Spiralize.org) to determine the child’s or group’s current **Spiral Dynamics** stage(s), noting **stage-mixing** (e.g., **Blue** with **Orange** traits).
2. **Select Focus Areas**: Choose one or two core subjects (e.g., Language Arts, Mathematics) and one supplementary area (e.g., SEL, Arts) to prioritize.
3. **Complete the Template**: Fill in the snapshot table with stage-specific activities, tools, assessments, and inclusivity adaptations, referencing **Teaching Strategies** (Section V.04) and **Stage-Specific Technology Use** (Section V.01).
4. **Adapt for Transitions/Events**: Adjust activities and tools for **stage transitions** or **major life events** using the **Transition Toolkit** (Sections II, IV, V).
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor outcomes with the **Individual Progress Tracker** (Spiralize.org) and update the snapshot as needed.
6. **Ensure Inclusivity**: Incorporate adaptations for neurodivergent learners (e.g., visual schedules for autistic children) and diverse contexts (e.g., free tools for low-resource settings).
7. **Review and Share**: Use the **Spiral Curriculum Planner** (Spiralize.org) to expand the snapshot into a full curriculum and share with the #SpiralParenting community (Spiralize.org).

## Applying the Curriculum Snapshot

- **Individual Use**: Parents can use the snapshot to align home learning with a child’s stage (e.g., **Red** math games for a 6-year-old with ADHD).
- **Classroom Use**: Educators can apply the snapshot to design stage-aligned lessons for groups, balancing multiple stages (e.g., **Purple** and **Blue** in a mixed classroom).
- **Transition Support**: Adjust activities/tools during **stage transitions** or **major life events** (e.g., familiar apps for **Blue** during a school move) using the **Transition Toolkit**.
- **Inclusivity**: Ensure tools and activities are accessible (e.g., offline apps for low-resource settings, sensory-friendly interfaces for neurodivergent learners).
- **Tracking and Scaling**: Use the **Individual Progress Tracker** to monitor outcomes and the **Spiral Curriculum Planner** to expand the snapshot into a full curriculum.
- **Collaboration**: Share snapshots with parents, educators, or the #SpiralParenting community (Spiralize.org) to align home and school practices.
