## 🧭 Part 1: Identify Your Anchors

List 3–5 values or principles that help you feel grounded, safe, or purposeful in life.

Examples: honesty, loyalty, prayer, service, kindness, responsibility, justice

| # | My Current Core Values |
|---|------------------------|
| 1 |                        |
| 2 |                        |
| 3 |                        |
| 4 |                        |

## 🕊️ Part 2: Source the Roots

For each value above, reflect:

- Where did I learn this?
- Was it modeled, taught, demanded, or discovered?
- Does it feel alive in me now?

Write short notes next to each value.

---

## 🔍 Part 3: Examine with Compassion

Choose one value that may feel outdated or limiting.

Ask:
- Is this value **still mine** — or someone else’s?  
- Does it serve me through love, or through fear?  
- What happens if I soften or rewrite it?

📝 Optional Reframe:

> “I once believed __________ because __________.  
> Now, I hold __________ because __________.”

## ✍️ Part 4: Write Your Evolving Code

Create a personal “living document” of your current guiding principles.  
Make it aspirational but kind. Grounded but flexible.

You can write it as:
- “I strive to…”  
- “I live by…”  
- “I remember that…”  
- “Even when I struggle, I return to…”

🧭 Example:

> • I strive to speak with honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable.  
> • I rest when I am tired — not only when I am done.  
> • I walk with integrity, even if no one sees.  
> • I forgive myself when I fall short.  
> • I am devoted to becoming, not perfection.

---

## 🌀 Part 5: Bless the Structure

Write a closing line to affirm your evolving code.

> “This is the structure I am building within — not to trap myself,  
but to become the person I’m learning to trust.”
