# 🔮 Purple Practice Card  
## 🧶 *Weaving the Sacred*

> _When the old stories wrap too tight,  
> we don’t tear them apart —  
> we reweave them with care._

---

### 🌈 Purpose:
To reconnect with your lineage, myths, and inherited patterns  
— and choose what threads continue forward.

---

### 🪡 What You’ll Need:
- A length of string, yarn, ribbon, or fabric scrap  
- Optional: a pen, beads, charms, small symbols  
- A quiet moment

---

### 🧵 Step 1: Ground in the Circle

Close your eyes.  
Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth.  
Imagine a circle of ancestors, elders, or memory-bearers around you —  
not judging, just witnessing.

Say (out loud or silently):  
> “I honor the threads that made me.  
> I now choose how to carry them forward.”

---

### 🪢 Step 2: Tie the Five Knots

For each of the following, tie a small knot, attach a bead, or speak the memory aloud:

1. A story you inherited  
2. A belief that shaped you  
3. A gift passed down (even if wrapped in pain)  
4. A ritual that still holds meaning  
5. A part of your lineage that wants to evolve

---

### 🔁 Step 3: Reflect & Bless

Hold what you’ve woven in your hands.

Ask yourself:
- Which thread is asking to continue?  
- Which one has completed its cycle?  
- What new thread would I like to add?

Say:
> “This weaving is not a trap.  
> It is a tapestry I’m learning to shape.  
> I belong — not by obedience, but by presence.”

---

### 🔥 Optional Ritual Use:
- Hang your weaving on a wall, altar, or doorknob  
- Bury it or burn it with intention to release or transform  
- Add to it over time as your Spiral deepens

---

### 🌟 Spiral Affirmation:

> I carry the sacred.  
> I am not bound by the past —  
> but I bless it  
> as I step toward the self  
> I now choose to become.
