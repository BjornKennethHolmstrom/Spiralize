### *Honoring the death of what was, and the birth of what wants to be.*

> The part that is emerging doesn’t have a name yet — only a pulse.”_

## 🌑 PART I: Letting Go of the Old Self

### 1. What external event, shift, or subtle unraveling has brought you to this threshold?

_(Write freely. This may be a job loss, a breakup, a new stage of life, an internal calling, or a quiet dissonance.)_

---

### 2. What belief or worldview used to define you here?

_(e.g., “Success means proving myself.” / “Love requires sacrifice.” / “If I’m good, I’ll be safe.”)_

---

### 3. What did this belief or identity give you?

_(Even if it no longer serves you, how did it once protect or empower you?)_

---

### 4. What are you grieving — even if it “shouldn’t” hurt?

_(Let this be messy and honest. Spiral transitions often involve unspoken grief.)_

---

## 🌒 PART II: Listening to the Liminal

### 5. What parts of your inner world feel “in-between”?

_(Not quite the old, not yet the new — write from the in-between voice.)_

---

### 6. What no longer resonates — but you’re still afraid to fully release?

_(You can honor fear *and* growth at once.)_

---

### 7. What whispers are you starting to hear from the next Spiral stage?

_(Not instructions — but sensations, symbols, desires, values, visions.)_

---

## 🌤 PART III: Making Space for the New

### 8. What qualities do you feel drawn to, even if you can’t live them fully yet?

_(e.g., stillness, embodiment, sovereignty, trust, creative play, mystery)_

---

### 9. What practices, environments, or relationships might support this new self?

_(Be gentle. Don’t force anything. You're planting, not harvesting.)_

---

### 10. If your transition were a season, what would it be?  
Why?

## 🪞 Closing Spiral Reflection

> “I bless the self I’m saying goodbye to.  
> I hold the self I cannot yet name.  
> I trust the Spiral to carry me through this sacred unraveling.”
