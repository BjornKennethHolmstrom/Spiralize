# 🌀 Beige Stabilization Card  
**When you feel like everything is too much — or not enough.**

### 🕊️ What’s Happening?

Your system may be entering **Beige** — the Spiral’s ground layer:  
- You’re overwhelmed  
- You can’t think clearly  
- You just want to feel safe or nothing at all  
- Your body is asking to down-regulate

This is not weakness.  
This is wisdom.

### 🌬️ What You Can Do

#### ✅ Do:
- Slow your breathing  
- Wrap in something warm  
- Dim the lights  
- Sit or lie down without goals  
- Eat something simple  
- Drink warm water  
- Ask for space — or quiet presence

#### 🧘 Repeat:
> “I don’t have to fix this.  
> I am still here.”

### 🛑 Avoid:
- Problem-solving  
- Analyzing  
- Explaining  
- Making decisions  
- Blaming yourself

(repeat 5 times)

Let this be enough.

### 🌱 Gentle Reminder:

You are not failing.  
You are **slowing down enough to survive**.  
This is the Spiral’s first step — and it is sacred.
