# 🪸 Coral Emergence Altar Template  
### *A place to hold what has not yet arrived*

> _“You don’t need to name it. You just need to make space for it.”_

---

## 🌌 Purpose

To offer a symbolic and embodied **edge-space**  
for those sensing a vision, feeling a transmission, or carrying something new —  
but who **can’t yet define it**.

Your Coral altar is not for worship.  
It’s for **witnessing emergence**.

---

## 🪞 How to Begin

1. Choose a place where you feel *slightly liminal*.  
   A shelf, a window nook, a corner of your desk, an outdoor stone.

2. Approach it with reverence — not as a project, but as **a dialogue**.

## 🌀 What to Include

There are no requirements — only resonance.  
Use the categories below to guide your intuition:

### 🔹 **THE UNKNOWN**  
_An object or image that evokes mystery._  
- A stone you don’t recognize  
- A tangle of thread  
- An empty jar  
- An unfinished symbol or drawing

> “This represents what I am not yet ready to understand.”

---

### 🔹 **THE EMERGING**  
_Something alive, growing, or shape-shifting._  
- A candle with uneven wax  
- A plant sprouting or decaying  
- A sketch in progress  
- A phrase or dream fragment

> “This holds what is trying to become real.”

---

### 🔹 **THE WITNESS**  
_Something that helps you hold space without needing answers._  
- A mirror  
- An eye symbol  
- An ancestral image  
- A symbol of inner stillness (shell, circle, bone)

> “This helps me stay with what is forming — without fixing it.”

---

### 🔹 **THE VESSEL**  
_Something that can “receive” the unspoken._  
- A small bowl  
- A folded piece of fabric  
- An envelope or container with no contents  
- A blank page or rock for writing fragments later

> “This holds the unsayable. The pattern I’m not yet ready to name.”

---

## ✍️ Optional Ritual Phrases

When visiting your altar, you may say:

> “I do not know what this is — but I’m listening.”  
> “I am not the source, but I am the strand.”  
> “This altar holds what I am becoming.”  
> “Let the next shape reveal itself in rhythm.”  

---

## 🪶 How to Use

- Sit near it when the vision feels strong or confusing  
- Add to it spontaneously when symbols appear in dreams or daily life  
- Let it stay unfinished — that’s the point  
- You can leave it alone for days or weeks  
- Let it become a **field-anchor** — not a goal
