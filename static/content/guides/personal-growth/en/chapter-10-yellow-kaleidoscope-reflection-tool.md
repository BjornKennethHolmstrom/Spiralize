## 🧠 Purpose:
To support those in Yellow — or in transition — to:
- Map inner systems and relationships  
- Hold paradox without collapse  
- Witness multiplicity without losing self  
- Move from intellectual overwhelm to integrative clarity

## 🗺️ Step 1: Name Your Inner Facets

Like a kaleidoscope, your identity is made of **shifting pieces**.  
Name the active “lenses” of your life right now:

| Lens Type            | Current Expression                                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Emotion              | (e.g., grief, curiosity, apathy)                     |
| Identity / Role      | (e.g., parent, strategist, artist)                   |
| Core Value in Play   | (e.g., freedom, service, truth)                      |
| Relational Pattern   | (e.g., withdrawing, bridging, over-caretaking)       |
| Mental Mode          | (e.g., analysis, confusion, mapping, visioning)      |
| Somatic State        | (e.g., tired, charged, numb, buzzing)                |
| Intuitive Pull       | (e.g., silence, ritual, integration, solitude)       |

## 🔄 Step 2: Gently Turn the Lens

Choose 2–3 of these elements and reflect:

- How do they interact?  
- Are any in **tension** with one another?  
- Is one **over-functioning** to compensate for another?  
- What pattern do they form **together**?

🌀 Let this reflection be slow, relational, and **non-fixing**.

> “What is this pattern trying to show me?”  
> “What wants to emerge if I stop controlling it?”

## 🌀 Step 3: Recognize the Kaleidoscope Moment

Write or draw a moment from the past week where you:

- Held multiple truths at once  
- Felt the pull between compassion and clarity  
- Observed without judging  
- Wanted to retreat — or transcend

What did you do?  
What might you do now, with more awareness?

## 🌟 Step 4: Spiral Orientation Check

Use the diagram below to **locate your center of gravity** right now —  
and your **stretch edge**.

| Spiral Voice        | Current Status       | Notes |
|---------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 🟢 Green (heart)     | (active / fading / calling) |       |
| 🟡 Yellow (mind)     | (grounded / overwhelmed / fluid) |       |
| 🔵 Blue (rules)      | (regressing to / resisting / releasing) |       |
| 🔷 Turquoise (field) | (yearning / glimpsing / integrating) |       |

---

## ✍️ Final Inquiry: What’s Enough?

Sometimes Yellow wants to hold it all.  
This question helps you **release** the kaleidoscope:

> “What is the **most compassionate thing** I can see clearly —  
> without having to understand everything right now?”

Let that be enough.
