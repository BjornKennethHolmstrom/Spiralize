# 📘 Appendix D: Spiral Life Timeline Template  
### *Trace your becoming through Spiral memory.*

> _“The Spiral has always been moving through you — now you get to see how.”_

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This timeline is for:
- Seeing your life through a Spiral-aware lens  
- Recognizing how each stage once served you  
- Honoring the selves you’ve lived, outgrown, or returned to  
- Naming turning points of rupture and reinvention

## 🌀 Step 1: Timeline Sketch

Draw a **horizontal spiral**, a flowing curve, or a segmented life line —  
your **personal Spiral path**.

Break it into **5–8 key chapters** or life phases.

Examples:

- “Early childhood in a tight-knit religious home”  
- “First job / Red-stage drive to prove myself”  
- “Post-breakup spiritual awakening”  
- “Green burnout and withdrawal”  
- “Beginning to trust my Yellow perception”  
- “Now — somewhere between Coral and not-knowing”

Don’t overthink stage placement — feel the **energy** of each chapter.

## 🔍 Step 2: Stage Resonance

For each life chapter, reflect:

| Life Chapter Title     | Years       | Felt Stage(s) | Core Themes                         |
|------------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
|                        |             |               | (e.g., survival, rebellion, order)   |
|                        |             |               | (e.g., truth-seeking, connection)    |
|                        |             |               |                                      |

🌀 Optional: Use Spiral colors or symbols as you fill in the timeline visually.

## 🪞 Step 3: Memory Markers

Across your life timeline, mark moments of:

- ✨ **Breakthrough** – times when something new awakened  
- 💔 **Breakdown** – times when an identity collapsed  
- 🪶 **Turning** – moments where you stepped into a new worldview  
- 🌀 **Regression** – times you softened or returned to something you thought you’d left behind

You can use icons, color dots, or simple words like:  
“🔁 Blue → Orange” • “💧 Green grief” • “🌌 Turquoise breath in nature”

## 🧘 Step 4: Spiral Inquiry Prompts

Choose a few of the following and write or draw:

1. **Where did you feel most ‘yourself’?**  
_(Which chapter felt most like “home” — and why?)_

2. **Where did you feel most trapped?**  
_(Were you ready to leave a worldview, but didn’t know how?)_

3. **Where did the Spiral move you most clearly?**  
_(What life event or insight catalyzed change?)_

4. **What part of your story still feels unfinished or paused?**  
_(Is there a stage you’re still learning to integrate?)_

5. **What version of you wants to be thanked — even if they were confused?**  
_(Offer them a sentence of gratitude.)_

> And the Spiral is still turning —  
> right here, inside you.
