## 🌀 Section 3: Reframing Your Drive

Orange's values don’t need to be abandoned — they need to evolve.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Productivity            | Presence and participation               |
| Achievement             | Meaningful contribution                  |
| Independence            | Interdependence with healthy boundaries  |
