## ⚡ Step 3: Surface the Friction

**What’s the most common tension or recurring theme?**  
_(e.g., “They think I’m too emotional.” / “I feel unseen.” / “We always clash on control vs. freedom.”)_

---

**In 1–2 sentences, describe how *you* see the world in this relationship:**  
_(What matters most to you?)_

---

**Now imagine how *they* might see it — through their stage logic:**  
_(What are they protecting or valuing?)_

---

## 🔄 Step 4: Reframe with Spiral Awareness

**What story is your worldview telling you about them?**  
_(e.g., “They don’t listen,” “They’re too rigid”)_

---

**What might their worldview be telling them about *you*?**

---

**How might both worldviews be trying to meet a valid human need?**

---

## 🧠 Step 5: Adjust the Approach

**How could you speak more “into their language”?**  
_(Use stage-informed framing — e.g., logic for Orange, feeling for Green, structure for Blue)_

---

**What truth do *you* need to hold steady — even if they can’t see it yet?**

---

**What would Spiral-conscious compassion look like here?**  
_(e.g., firm boundary with warmth, letting go of being right, validating their story without erasing your own)_

## 🧘 Final Reflection

> “We are not wrong for being different.  
> We are simply carrying different maps —  
> and meeting each other at the edge of our understanding.”
