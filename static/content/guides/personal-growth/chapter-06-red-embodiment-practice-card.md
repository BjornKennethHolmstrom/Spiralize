# 🛡️ Red Embodiment Practice Card  
## 🔥 *Claim Your Fire, Carry It Cleanly*

> _You were never too much — you were just learning how to hold your power._

---

### 🌀 When to Use This Card:
- You feel angry, disrespected, or silenced  
- You’re scared to assert yourself but know it’s time  
- You feel scattered or emotionally volatile  
- You want to **access** your Red — or **reclaim** it after shame

---

## 🧍‍♂️ Red Activation Ritual

### 1. **Stand Tall — Root Down**

- Feet shoulder-width apart  
- Knees soft, spine tall  
- Imagine fire traveling from earth → soles → spine → crown

🗣️ Say aloud:  
> “This is my body. This is my voice. This is my space.”

---

### 2. **Claim 3 Boundaries**

Speak or write three sentences:
- “I will no longer tolerate __________.”  
- “I have a right to __________.”  
- “I choose to protect __________.”

Let your voice be steady — not polite.

---

### 3. **Anchor the Fire**

Bring one hand to your belly, one to your chest.  
Breathe deep. Feel the heat.

Then ask:
- “Where does this fire want to go?”  
- “What action serves — rather than harms?”  
- “What does my anger protect?”

---

## 🧠 Remember:
Red is not rage — it’s **rooted will**.

When you hold it cleanly:
- You say what’s true without punishing others  
- You walk tall without domination  
- You burn with clarity, not chaos

---

## 🚫 Avoid When in Red Overwhelm:
- Venting to those who can’t hold it  
- Passive-aggressive behavior  
- Acting from shame or panic  
- Collapsing your truth to keep the peace

Instead:  
Move. Breathe. Name. Regulate. Then speak.
