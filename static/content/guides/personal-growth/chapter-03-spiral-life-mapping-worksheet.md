# 🌀 Spiral Life Mapping Worksheet  
**Discover the stages of becoming you’ve already lived.**

> _“You are not beginning the Spiral now — you are remembering the shape it already left in you.”_

---

## 📜 Instructions:

This worksheet helps you reflect on your life as a Spiral journey — one that’s unfolding through values, identities, ruptures, and renewals.

- Go slowly. Pause when needed.  
- Don’t try to get it “right” — intuition is your compass.  
- This is not about assigning stages to your identity — it’s about honoring your evolution.

## 🧭 Step 1: Name Your Life Chapters

List 5–8 phases of your life that felt distinct — by age, theme, role, or transformation.

| Life Chapter Name            | Approximate Years | Notes / Core Memory |
|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| e.g., “Growing up Catholic”  | 1992–2006         | School, family, obedience |
| e.g., “High school rebellion”| 2006–2008         | Anger, defiance, new identity |
|                              |                   |                      |
|                              |                   |                      |
|                              |                   |                      |
|                              |                   |                      |

## 🌈 Step 2: Spiral Stage Resonance

For each life chapter, read the stage summaries below and **circle or star** the one that resonates most — or choose multiple if needed.

| Spiral Stage | Essence                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Beige**     | Survival, sensory overwhelm, trauma patterns  
| **Purple**    | Ritual, family, emotional inheritance  
| **Red**       | Fire, independence, raw willpower  
| **Blue**      | Rules, obedience, certainty  
| **Orange**    | Goals, success, personal agency  
| **Green**     | Belonging, empathy, emotional truth  
| **Yellow**    | Systems thinking, inner pattern awareness  
| **Turquoise** | Interbeing, presence, sacred silence  
| **Coral**     | Edge-walking, transformation, solitude and paradox

## 🪞 Step 4: Reflect

Write down or contemplate:

- Which stage or worldview shaped you the most?  
- Where do you feel like you’re standing *now*?  
- Which old self are you honoring — or letting go?  
- What stage might be whispering at the edge of your awareness?
