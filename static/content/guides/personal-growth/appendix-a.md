## 🧘 Spiral Reminders

- **No stage is better — only more complex and inclusive.**  
- You contain all the stages — even the ones you’ve outgrown.  
- Regression is not failure — it’s Spiral rhythm.  
- The Spiral is not linear. It spirals.  
- You can’t force someone to leap a stage — but you *can* love them inside their current one.  
- You are not “on” the Spiral.  
  > *You are the Spiral — unfolding, integrating, remembering.*
