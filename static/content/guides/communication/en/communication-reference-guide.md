## Survival-Oriented Values (Beige)

## Quick Diagnostic Questions

When communication breaks down, ask yourself:

**1. Which value system am I speaking from?**
Am I communicating from my own center of gravity without translating?

**2. Which value system is the other person primarily in right now?**
Am I accurately perceiving their worldview or projecting my own?

**3. Am I meeting them where they are or where I want them to be?**
Am I starting with their reality or my agenda?

**4. What matters most to them that I'm not addressing?**
What core values am I missing or dismissing?

**5. Is my language resonating or creating distance?**
Are my words connecting or bouncing off?

**6. Am I judging their value system rather than understanding it?**
Am I internally dismissing them as "less developed"?

**7. What would bridge-building look like here?**
How could I honor both their values and the insight I want to share?

---

## Emergency Troubleshooting

**When someone shuts down:**
- Stop talking
- Check: Have I violated their core values?
- Acknowledge: "I sense I've lost connection. Let's pause."
- Reset: Return to relationship, then try again

**When conflict escalates:**
- Don't defend your position
- Reflect back what matters to them
- Acknowledge legitimate concerns
- Find common ground before proceeding

**When you feel judged or dismissed:**
- Notice your own defensive reaction
- Remember: Their resistance may be value-based, not personal
- Take a breath and return to curiosity
- Ask yourself: What am I missing about their perspective?

**When nothing seems to work:**
- Accept that timing may be wrong
- Let go of your agenda
- Focus purely on understanding
- Consider that the framework may not be appropriate here

---

## Remember

This guide provides patterns, not rules. Real humans are far more complex than any framework can capture. Use this guide to orient yourself, but always prioritize the living, breathing person in front of you over theoretical purity.

The map is never the territory. Let your authentic care for others guide you more than your knowledge of stages.

When in doubt, choose connection over correctness, relationship over framework, and love over being right.
