## Appendix D: Crisis Support Cards by Stage  
*What to say — and what not to — when a worldview is unraveling.*

Each Spiral stage responds to crisis differently.  
What calms one may provoke another.  
What feels supportive to a Green client may sound patronizing to a Red one.  
What grounds an Orange achiever might destabilize a Turquoise mystic.

This appendix provides short, printable “support cards” organized by stage, designed for use in:

- Acute distress or destabilization  
- Transition states (breakdown, breakthrough, integration)  
- Coaching, therapy, emergency sessions, or peer support  
- Creating developmentally resonant language, tone, and presence
