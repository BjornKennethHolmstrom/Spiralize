## 3. Stage-Based Blind Spots

> Reflect on how your own worldview may limit how you perceive others.

**What client behaviors consistently frustrate or confuse you?**  
(e.g., impulsivity, rule-breaking, dependency, rigidity)  

...

**Which of your values do you tend to project as “universal”?**  

...

**Which stage(s) do you subtly pathologize or idealize?**  

...

---

## 4. Therapist Shadow Patterns

> Consider how unresolved aspects of earlier stages may surface in your work.

**When do you feel threatened, reactive, or over-controlling?**  

...

**Do you tend to over-identify with clients at a particular stage? Why?**  

...

**What part of the Spiral do you avoid exploring in yourself?**  

...

---

## 5. Supervision & Growth Edges

> Spiral self-awareness is a practice — not a perfection.

**Who do you turn to for supervision or developmental mirroring?**  

...

**What practices support you in integrating multiple stages?**  
(e.g., somatic work, journaling, dialogue with peers, meditation)  

...

**What would a Spiral expansion look like for you right now — not just upward, but inward and across?**  

...

## 6. Final Reflection

> “What I most need to remember when I hold others through their development is...”

...
