## Appendix C: Spiral-Aware Assessment Tools  
*Finding the shape of development — without fixing people to it.*

Assessment in Spiral-aware practice is not about placing clients in boxes.  
It is about listening for the logic behind the language, the values behind the behavior, and the story beneath the symptoms.

This appendix offers tools to:

- Sense stage patterns  
- Support client self-location  
- Reflect on growth and developmental edges  
- Use values and worldview, not pathology, as the primary lens

### C.1 Intake Questions and Developmental Assessment Prompts  
*Start where they are — but listen for how they make meaning.*

Here are sample Spiral-informed intake questions designed to reveal developmental structure through values, worldview, language, and priorities — not through test scores.

These can be used in:

- Intake forms  
- First sessions  
- Reflective writing prompts  
- Coaching discovery calls  
- Ongoing developmental check-ins

#### 1. Meaning-Making and Purpose

- What gives your life meaning right now?  
- What do you feel called to do or become?  
- When things fall apart, what helps you make sense of it?

🌀 Look for: Order (Blue), Purpose (Orange), Relational Identity (Green), Pattern/Awareness (Yellow)

#### 2. Conflict and Challenge

- What’s your usual response to conflict?  
- How do you handle people who see the world very differently?  
- What types of decisions are hardest for you?

🌀 Look for: Fight/Flight (Red), Rule-following (Blue), Consensus tension (Green), Systems trade-offs (Yellow)

#### 3. Self and Identity

- How would you describe who you are?  
- Has your sense of self changed over time?  
- What parts of you feel in tension or transition right now?

🌀 Look for: Role identity (Blue), Performance identity (Orange), Relational/multivoiced (Green), Fluid self-awareness (Yellow+)

#### 4. Values and Truth

- How do you decide what’s right or true?  
- What happens when someone challenges your beliefs?  
- Is there a truth you’ve outgrown recently?

🌀 Stage-specific answers will reveal worldview logic:
  - Blue: “It’s in the Bible”  
  - Orange: “I looked at the data”  
  - Green: “Everyone’s truth is valid”  
  - Yellow: “It depends on the context”

#### 5. Emotional and Relational World

- What emotions are easiest — and hardest — for you to feel?  
- Who are you, in relationships?  
- What do you want most from those close to you?

🌀 Track:  
- Suppression (Blue/Orange)  
- Diffusion (Green)  
- Integration (Yellow)  
- Non-dual presence (Turquoise+)

#### 6. Inner Transitions

- Are you in a time of change or transition?  
- What does it feel like inside — physically, emotionally, existentially?  
- Is something trying to emerge?

🌀 These answers often point to the edge between stages — where therapy becomes transformation.

### Optional Therapist Prompts

After the intake session, use these for reflection:

- What worldview logic is the client *speaking from* most often?  
- Where are their tensions, contradictions, or unspoken longings?  
- What value system seems to dominate their identity story?  
- What might be *emerging* beneath their current center of gravity?

> Spiral-aware assessment is not about boxing in.  
> It’s about *listening to the shape of becoming*.

### C.2 Values-Mapping Exercises and Stage Location Methods  
*Your values are the fingerprints of your worldview.*

Each Spiral stage expresses a unique constellation of values, which can shift — slowly or suddenly — during times of transition.

Mapping a client’s core values, and how they relate to life decisions, relationships, and meaning-making, is a gentle yet powerful way to sense developmental patterns.

#### Exercise 1: Core Values Clarification  
Ask the client to reflect on or journal answers to the following:

1. List your top 5 values right now (e.g., freedom, safety, justice, growth, belonging)  
2. For each, describe how you live that value — or struggle to  
3. Which of these values feel like they’ve changed in recent years?  
4. Which ones do you feel pressure to adopt that may not feel authentic?

🌀 Use a Spiral lens to spot stage patterns in how the values are held:

| Example Value | Possible Spiral Expressions |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| **Freedom**   | Red (control), Orange (autonomy), Yellow (fluidity), Turquoise (inter-being) |
| **Belonging** | Purple (tribal), Blue (social role), Green (emotional connection) |
| **Truth**     | Blue (absolute), Orange (empirical), Green (relative), Yellow (contextual) |

#### Exercise 2: Value Conflict Mapping

Have the client map two or more values that feel in tension:

> Example: *“Freedom vs. Responsibility”*  
> → Explore where that tension is felt (body, relationships, decisions)  
> → Explore how each value may point to a different developmental structure  

Ask:
- “Which voice wants freedom? What does it say?”  
- “Which voice wants structure? How old is that part of you?”  
- “Is there a deeper harmony trying to emerge?”

🌀 Value conflicts often signal an edge between stages.

### Visual Tool: Spiral Value Rings

Create concentric rings labeled with Spiral stages (from Beige to Coral).  
Then, place sticky notes or symbols representing values on the ring where the value feels most resonant.

Let clients notice:
- Cluster patterns  
- Tensions (e.g. Orange “success” next to Green “equality”)  
- Movement over time

🌀 This makes development visible, not diagnostic.

### Stage Location Heuristics (for Therapist Use)

Spiral stage is not a diagnosis, but here are key indicators that can help you sense where a client may be centered developmentally:

| Area           | Questions to Reflect On                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Language**   | What’s the underlying logic? Is it binary? Strategic? Relational? Paradoxical? |
| **Conflict**   | Do they avoid it, fight, debate, defer, synthesize, or hold tension? |
| **Narrative**  | Do they speak in stories of order, growth, trauma, systems, or symbols? |
| **Emotion**    | Is there repression, flooding, integration, non-dual spaciousness?   |
| **Spirituality**| Is it rule-based, personal, archetypal, energetic, or silent?        |

> You’re not trying to “place” the client —  
> you’re trying to understand how they make meaning.

### Collaborative Inquiry Prompt (Client-Therapist Dialogue)

- “Do you ever feel like different parts of you are living in different realities?”  
- “What version of you shows up at work vs. in solitude?”  
- “Are there parts of your past self you’ve outgrown — but still love?”

These questions help the client gently recognize multiple stage voices within themselves, and begin to own the Spiral — not as a judgment, but a *journey*.

### C.3 Developmental Journaling Prompts and Reflective Practices  
*Write the spiral you are becoming.*

The following prompts help clients explore:
- Their stage center-of-gravity  
- Emerging tensions between stages  
- Values, identity, and worldview shifts  
- Moments of breakthrough, rupture, or integration

🌀 Journaling can reveal pattern beneath story — and self-befriending across timelines.

#### Prompt Set 1: Life Through Spiral Eyes

- What core belief did your family or culture raise you with?  
- When did you first begin to question that? What replaced it?  
- What is something you believed ten years ago that no longer fits?  
- Who were you before your last major life transition? Who are you now?

🌀 These uncover stage shifts through biography.

#### Prompt Set 2: Inner Dialogue Between Stages

Clients can be invited to write or role-play two parts of themselves in conversation — from different Spiral perspectives.

Examples:

- A Red part who wants freedom vs. a Blue part who wants rules  
- An Orange achiever vs. a Green part longing for connection  
- A Yellow systems thinker vs. a Green empath resisting detachment

**Instructions:**  
Give each part a voice. Let them speak.  
Then ask: “Is there a third voice emerging between them?”

🌀 This practice surfaces *internal Spiral multiplicity*.

#### Prompt Set 3: Developmental Edge Discovery

- What are you starting to see differently lately?  
- What truths are becoming more complex — or less useful?  
- What part of your life feels like it no longer fits your current self?  
- What’s asking to be born next?

🌀 These help clients name the edge of their transformation.

#### Prompt Set 4: Reflection Ritual (Monthly or Seasonal)

Clients can use this format to track change over time.

🌒 Old patterns that are fading:
🌕 New ways of being that are emerging:
🌓 Tensions I’m holding between parts of myself:
🌑 Questions I’m sitting with now:
