# Community Structures Examples

## <stage:beige>

### Scattered Kin Groups

**Characteristics:** Small, impermanent, focused on survival with minimal bonding

Beige communities form temporarily and dissolve when resources shift.

**Examples:**
- A family group huddling together in harsh weather
- Nomadic movements without attachment to place or others

## <stage:purple>

### Tribal and Clan Villages

**Characteristics:** Extended families, oral tradition, sacred geography

Purple communities are bound by bloodlines, ancestry, and ritual practices.

**Examples:**
- Tribal villages organized around elder councils
- Sacred meeting places marked by ancestral myths
- Living close to nature in cycles of the land

## <stage:red>

### Dominated Factions and Fear-Based Clusters

**Characteristics:** Power-centered communities held by force, loyalty, and threat

Red communities are bound by charismatic leadership or threat of violence.

**Examples:**
- Gangs with strong identity and rules enforced by threat
- Small warlord-controlled settlements
- Youth crews built around loyalty and rebellion

## <stage:blue>

### Traditional and Law-Governed Towns

**Characteristics:** Stable, ordered, morally bound neighborhoods with defined roles

Blue communities are structured by duty, respect, and shared rules.

**Examples:**
- Religious parishes or rural towns with strong local culture
- Suburbs with enforced codes of conduct
- Casted-based community divisions in traditional societies

## <stage:orange>

### Individualistic and Competitive Urban Environments

**Characteristics:** Privacy-valuing, economically-driven, achievement-oriented

Orange communities are based more on proximity than shared values.

**Examples:**
- Urban condo blocks with little social connection
- Gated communities of high-performers
- Tech hubs focused on startup culture

## <stage:green>

### Intentional and Cooperative Communities

**Characteristics:** Shared values, inclusion, environmental and emotional care

Green communities thrive on mutual respect and co-creation.

**Examples:**
- Eco-villages and permaculture communities
- Co-housing where meals and chores are shared
- Neighborhood cooperatives with consensus governance

## <stage:yellow>

### Functional, Modular, Networked Communities

**Characteristics:** Purpose-aligned, self-organizing, adaptable across scales

Yellow communities operate more like intelligent systems than fixed places.

**Examples:**
- Distributed learning hubs linked by shared purpose
- Online-offline hybrid tribes with flexible membership
- Collaboratives that form and dissolve around projects

## <stage:turquoise>

### Planetary and Ecological Communities

**Characteristics:** Embedded in nature, spiritually coherent, whole-system aware

Turquoise communities mirror the rhythms and intelligence of Earth.

**Examples:**
- Bioregional village networks aligned with watershed and forest cycles
- Planetary nomadic communities balancing travel and rootedness
- Communities with rituals of planetary attunement and care

## <stage:coral>

### Sovereign Co-Creative Clusters

**Characteristics:** Living nexuses of evolution; autonomy balanced with emergence

Coral communities evolve dynamically through sovereign interplay.

**Examples:**
- Fractal co-living spaces that shift form with inhabitants
- Guild-like creative constellations across disciplines
- Villages where form, flow, and purpose reconfigure freely

## <stage:ultraviolet>

### Presence-Based Gatherings

**Characteristics:** No permanent structure; only shared resonance and appearance

Ultra-Violet communities form through energetic attraction and disappear without trace.

**Examples:**
- Silent camps where leadership is never declared
- Pilgrim circles who know where to meet without planning
- Collective field holding without defined edges

## <stage:clear>

### Beyond Community

**Characteristics:** No separation, no roles, no boundaries; only open being together

At Clear, community dissolves — not through isolation, but through total belonging.

**Examples:**
- The forest and you are the same
- No need to “belong,” because nothing is excluded
- Total communion, without definition or form
