# Political Systems Examples

## <stage:beige>

### Survival Bands

**Characteristics:** No formal governance, instinctual responses to immediate threats

Beige political systems barely exist as formal structures. Groups form and dissolve based on immediate survival needs, with minimal coordination beyond what's necessary for finding food, water, and shelter.

**Examples:**
- Hunter-gatherer bands during extreme hardship
- Temporary groups formed during natural disasters
- Refugee groups in initial flight from danger
- Communities immediately after societal collapse
- Homeless encampments with minimal organization

## <stage:purple>

### Tribal & Kinship Governance

**Characteristics:** Elder/shaman leadership, tradition-based, ancestral authority, magical thinking

Purple political systems organize around blood ties, shared traditions, and spiritual beliefs. Authority derives from age, perceived connection to spirits/ancestors, or ritual role, and governance focuses on maintaining group cohesion and traditional ways.

**Examples:**
- Indigenous tribal councils led by elders or shamans
- Clan-based governance systems in traditional societies
- Village councils in traditional communities
- Religious communities governed by spiritual leaders
- Extended family networks with patriarchal/matriarchal authority

## <stage:red>

### Feudal & Warlord Systems

**Characteristics:** Might makes right, power-based hierarchy, personal loyalty

Red political systems establish authority through strength and charisma. Leaders gain and maintain power through force, reward loyal followers with status and resources, and make decisions unilaterally based on personal desire rather than abstract principles.

**Examples:**
- Historical feudal systems with lords and vassals
- Warlord-controlled territories
- Organized crime syndicates
- Military juntas and dictatorships
- Authoritarian regimes centered around a strongman figure
- Gang-controlled neighborhoods

## <stage:blue>

### Traditional & Authoritarian Systems

**Characteristics:** Hierarchical, rule-based, rigid social order, appeals to absolute authority

Blue political systems create stability through formalized hierarchies, clear rules, and established traditions. Authority derives from established positions, sacred texts, or historical precedent, and governance focuses on maintaining order and proper conduct.

**Examples:**
- Traditional monarchies with divine right justification
- Theocratic states governed by religious authorities
- Command economies with centralized planning
- Authoritarian one-party states with ideological orthodoxy
- Colonial administrative systems
- Strictly hierarchical bureaucracies

## <stage:orange>

### Market Democracies & Competitive Systems

**Characteristics:** Merit-based, competitive, strategic, results-focused

Orange political systems embrace competition, economic growth, and individual achievement. Authority derives from democratic process, constitutional frameworks, or demonstrated expertise, and governance focuses on creating conditions for progress and development.

**Examples:**
- Liberal democracies with market economies
- Corporate-influenced governance systems
- Meritocratic civil service structures
- International trade organizations and agreements
- Management by objectives in government agencies
- Technology-driven "smart government" initiatives

## <stage:green>

### Pluralistic & Egalitarian Systems

**Characteristics:** Inclusive, consensus-seeking, focused on social justice and equality

Green political systems emphasize inclusion, participation, and care for all members of society. Authority derives from inclusive processes, demonstrated commitment to equality, and facilitation skills, and governance focuses on ensuring all voices are heard.

**Examples:**
- Scandinavian social democracies
- Participatory budgeting initiatives
- Progressive city governments with strong citizen input
- Cooperative governance models
- Organizations using sociocratic decision-making
- Environmental governance frameworks emphasizing stakeholder involvement

## <stage:yellow>

### Adaptive & Integral Systems

**Characteristics:** Functionally-oriented, flexible, context-sensitive, systems-aware

Yellow political systems recognize complexity and adapt structures to fit specific contexts. Authority is distributed based on functional needs rather than rigid hierarchies, and governance focuses on creating conditions for emergence and adaptation.

**Examples:**
- Emerging networked governance models
- Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)
- City governments using complexity-aware approaches
- Organizations combining hierarchical and network structures
- Platform cooperatives with flexible governance
- Adaptive multi-stakeholder governance initiatives

## <stage:turquoise>

### Living Systems Governance

**Characteristics:** Evolutionary purpose, planetary awareness, emergence-focused

Turquoise political systems operate with awareness of global interconnection and evolutionary purpose. They create conditions for human and ecological flourishing, maintain long time horizons, and facilitate emergence of more complex and integrated social forms.

**Examples:**
- Global commons governance experiments
- Bioregional governance initiatives
- Organizations explicitly designed around evolutionary purpose
- Networks addressing planetary-scale challenges
- Indigenous governance systems reconnecting with traditional wisdom while integrating modern approaches

## <stage:coral>

### Evolutionary Creative Governance

**Characteristics:** Dynamic balance of sovereign autonomy and evolutionary coherence

Coral political systems dynamically balance individual sovereignty and collective coherence. They maintain creative tension between autonomy and connection, adapt rapidly to emergent conditions, and embody both structured order and creative chaos as needed.

**Examples:**
- Emerging "next stage" governance experiments
- Rapidly adaptive crisis response networks
- Organizations balancing strong leadership with distributed intelligence
- Visionary initiatives that catalyze transformation across multiple systems

## <stage:ultraviolet>

### üü£ Ultra-Violet Governance  
**Field-Conscious Alignment & Post-Systemic Cooperation**  
**Characteristics:** Transparent resonance, non-hierarchical emergence, wisdom-led coherence

Ultra-Violet governance is not a system but a field of consciousness. Decisions arise through deep mutual sensing. No roles, no representation ‚Äî only harmonic participation. The ‚Äúpolity‚Äù becomes a field of presence where action ripens collectively.

**Examples:**
- A community that evolves shared action through collective meditation and synchronic insight  
- Indigenous-like gatherings where no one speaks until moved by the whole  
- Fictional depictions like the Anarresti society in *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K. Le Guin  
- Sci-fi councils that dissolve when harmony has been reached (e.g., the Elders in *Hyperion*)

## <stage:clear>

### ‚ö™ Clear Governance  
**Post-Political Presence & Natural Flow of Right Action**  
**Characteristics:** Governance without governors, action without structures, clarity without deliberation

Clear governance is what remains when the very idea of politics has dissolved. It is the space where nothing is governed, and yet all flows in right alignment. No policies, no debates ‚Äî just transparent living where needs meet fulfillment through unmediated intelligence.

**Examples:**
- The silent disappearance of governing bodies as coherence self-regulates  
- Monasteries with no abbot, where tasks emerge from stillness  
- Fictional harmonies like the Taoist village in *Zhuangzi*, where the sage leaves no trace  
- Dreamlike utopias from mystic visions where governance is indistinguishable from grace
