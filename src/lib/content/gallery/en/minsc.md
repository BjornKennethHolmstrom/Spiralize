# Minsc

Minsc is chaos wrapped in courage — a berserker with a hamster sidekick and a heart of gold. He fights not for strategy, but for justice. Not for glory, but to protect those he loves.

His Red is raw and righteous: he charges into battle without fear, shouts down evil, and answers moral complexity with a punch (or twelve).

Yet beneath his explosive exterior is Purple wonder: he believes in Boo — not just as a pet, but as a sacred guide. Their bond is spiritual, mysterious, and real.

And then there’s Green — his unconditional love for his companions, his defense of the voiceless, his willingness to grow and feel. He may be loud, but his heart listens.

Minsc is not Spiral-aware — but he is Spiral-true. He reminds us that wisdom doesn't always sound wise. Sometimes, it squeaks.
