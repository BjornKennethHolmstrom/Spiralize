# Lara Croft

Lara Croft began as a pop-culture icon of power and control — fearless, flawless, and iconic. But over time, she became more Spiral-aware.

Her early Orange shines in her independence, sharp intellect, and elite competence. She climbs, deciphers, survives — alone, adaptable, and unstoppable. She is the archetypal achiever, carving her path through ancient puzzles and mortal peril.

Her Red flares when the mission demands ruthlessness. She breaks rules. She takes by force. She leads by will.

But in her most recent arcs, Green begins to emerge. She hesitates before killing. She mourns. She questions the impact of her actions — not just on herself, but on the cultures and histories she interacts with. Her empathy grows with her experience.

Lara’s Spiral journey is far from over — but she’s no longer just a hero of conquest. She is becoming a seeker of meaning.
