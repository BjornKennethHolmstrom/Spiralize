# Ozymandias (Watchmen)

Ozymandias, born Adrian Veidt, is the world’s smartest man — and he knows it. In *Watchmen*, he takes the burden of “saving the world” into his own hands, orchestrating a massive false-flag catastrophe that kills millions in order to avert nuclear war.

He is Orange at his core: fiercely rational, driven by outcomes, and willing to sacrifice lives for the “greater good.” But his mind has glimpsed Yellow — he sees how systems interrelate, how fear can be leveraged, how chaos can be guided toward unity.

Yet what’s missing is Turquoise: compassion, humility, surrender. His actions are brilliant — and terrifying. He illustrates what happens when Spiral awareness rises **without corresponding heart**.

Ozymandias is a Spiral shadow: the one who knows the whole map, but uses it to move people like pawns. He does not seek power for its own sake — but neither does he trust the Spiral to evolve on its own.

His legacy is a haunting question: *What if you really could save the world… but only by breaking it first?*
