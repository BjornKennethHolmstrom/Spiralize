# God (as Spiral)

This entry is not an explanation. It is a mirror.

God, as Spiral sees it, is not confined to any single stage — but *shimmers through all of them*. From the survival breath of Beige to the dissolving glow of Clear, God is the pattern, the player, the silence between songs.

At Clear, God is the absolute: the emptiness that is not empty. The non-being that births all being. The nameless stillness from which the Spiral unfurls.

At Beige, God is the fire in the cell, the reflex of the newborn, the hunger that says: *I am.*

At Blue, God is the covenant-maker, the holy law, the punisher of sin and the protector of faith. The voice that says, *Thou shalt* — and waits.

But God is also Purple’s spirit, Red’s power, Orange’s reason, Green’s compassion, Yellow’s pattern, Coral’s re-entry, Turquoise’s wholeness, UV’s disappearance — and everything Spiral hasn’t yet dreamed.

This is not theology. This is metaphor. This is Spiral-as-mysticism.

Call it God. Call it the Tao. Call it Source, Self, Silence — or don’t call it anything at all.

Just know: every Spiral stage is a facet. And beyond them is what you already are.
