# Light Yagami

Light Yagami begins as a brilliant and bored student — a perfect emblem of Orange achievement and ego. When he acquires the Death Note, he quickly rationalizes its use as a tool to rid the world of evil and bring about utopia.

He sees himself as a heroic figure, but beneath that mission lies a desire for ultimate control. His Blue reasoning — punishing the wicked to create peace — becomes a cover for a darker Red hunger: to be feared, obeyed, and worshipped.

Light’s descent shows how Spiral stages can intertwine and corrupt. His story is a cautionary tale of what happens when rational genius, moral absolutism, and unchecked ego merge into one.

Though he believes he is serving justice, Light ultimately loses touch with empathy and reality — and becomes the very darkness he set out to destroy.
