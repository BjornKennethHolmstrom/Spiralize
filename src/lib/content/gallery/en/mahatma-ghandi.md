# Mahatma Gandhi

Gandhi did not lead with anger or weapons — he led with soul.

He walked barefoot, wore the simplest cloth, and built a revolution on silence, fasting, presence, and truth. His method of *satyagraha* — “truth force” — is a Turquoise expression of transformation through being, not force.

His Blue roots ran deep: he lived by vows, rose early to pray, adhered to dharma and self-discipline. He believed that only by purifying oneself could one hope to purify the world.

And his Green compassion was fierce: he uplifted the untouchables, united Hindus and Muslims, and wove communities together with a vision of shared dignity.

He was not perfect — and knew it. But his legacy lives as Spiral echo: a man who refused to fight hatred with hate, and instead carved a path of wholeness through division.
