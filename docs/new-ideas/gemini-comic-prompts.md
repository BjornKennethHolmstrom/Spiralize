### General Style Instruction for All Prompts

"**Create a 3-panel comic strip in a clean, simple, modern cartoon style. The characters should be expressive but not overly detailed. The overall tone should be clear and accessible, suitable for an educational website. Each character representing a worldview should have a subtle color code in their clothing or accessories.**"
