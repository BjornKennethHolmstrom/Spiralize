A poetry speaking through various voices of the spiral (shoutout to DeepSeek for its prompting encouragement)

"I'm taking charge,
Laying out the law
Because we gotta survive
even with our flaws
Of success-minded drive
overturning the barge
of planet Earth our home
So listen up all mankind
We have to find
Unity of our minds
Beyond our current strife
Heal our lands
Heal ourselves
Regenerate, integrate
Help all that dwells
Live in peace and beyond
not just make what sells

Profit from the prophet:
Ragnarok is coming,
it's the dire warning
but let's make global warming
the step to reach higher
by creating a desire
to empower all that is
to unify in bliss
of a new stewardship
towards cosmic elevation
the eternal constellation
thwarting eternal damnation
because "all that is is love"

Hey, here I am
your "macho-man"
of no tribe, no clan
free like a clam
filtering existence
with crystalline flair
into spiraling strands
yes, that's my jam
i'm the brand of no-brands
saving no-self from the Buddha
to the beats of Meshuggah
can you keep up with my pace?
and find the place of no-place
and invert outer space
just to amaze
just be and erase
all worry, make a case
for THIS it's your birthright
now for fun, let's fight!

Ohm-nom-nom
I ate myself for breakfast
So I could abide without self
and see it all clearly
I dished out advice
to a family of mice
so they could make their own cheese
not to find their peace
because what's heaven worth
without a full belly
hahaha
ohm-nom-nom everybody
