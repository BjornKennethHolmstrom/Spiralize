"VOICES OF THE SPIRAL: A POEM IN FOUR ACTS"

*What happens when evolution gets poetic? This piece channels the raw, clashing, and ultimately transcendent voices of Spiral Dynamics—from survivalist urgency to cosmic play. It’s not about the Spiral; it becomes the Spiral.

Read it aloud. Let it itch your old memes and tickle the new ones. Then, dare to add your own verse.*

—Contribute your spiral poetry below—

**PART 1 (Beige/Red/Blue/Orange/Green)**
*"I'm taking charge,  
laying out the law¹—  
because we gotta survive²  
even with our flaws.  

- **¹Blue**: Hierarchical authority ("laying out the law").  
- **²Orange/Beige**: Survival + progress ("gotta survive," "success-minded drive"). 

Of success-minded drive,  
capsizing the barge  
of Earth—our only home.  
So listen up, all mankind:  

We have to find  
unity of our minds  
beyond this strife.  
Heal our lands,  
heal ourselves,  
regenerate, integrate—  
help all that dwells,  
not just chase what sells.  
Live in peace.  
And beyond.  

**PART 2 (Orange/Turquoise)**
Profit from the prophet³:  
Ragnarok⁴ is coming  
(it’s the dire warning),  
but let’s spin global warming  
into steps toward higher⁵—  
create a desire  
to empower all that is,  
unify in bliss  

- **³Orange**: Cynical opportunism ("Profit from the prophet").  
- **⁴Nordic flavor**: "Ragnarök" lands harder in Swedish (mythic Blue/Orange clash).  
- **⁵Turquoise**: Crisis as evolution ("steps toward higher").  


of new stewardship,  
cosmic elevation,  
eternal constellation,  
thwarting damnation’s narration—  
for all that is, is love.  

**PART 3 (Yellow/Coral)**
Hey, here I am,  
your ‘macho-man’  
of no tribe, no clan,  
free like a clam,  
filtering existence  
with crystalline flair  
into spiraling strands  
(yes, that’s my jam).  

I’m the brand of no-brands⁶,  
saving no-self from the Buddha⁷  
to the beats of Meshuggah⁸—  

- **⁶Coral**: "no-brands" = post-identity play.  
- **⁷Yellow**: Deconstructs spirituality + metal (meta-humor).  
- **⁸Swedish metal**: "Meshuggah" keeps the joke (band name + Hebrew for "crazy").  

can you match my reckless pace?  
map the no-place’s hiding place?  
invert outer space just to amaze,  
just be and erase all worry?  

Make a case for THIS—  
it’s your birthright.  
Now, for fun…  
let’s fight!  

**PART 4 (Coral)**
Ohm-nom-nom⁹:  
I ate myself for breakfast¹⁰  
so I could abide without self  
and see it all clearly.  

- **⁹Universal joke**: Works in both languages—gluttony meets nirvana.  
- **¹⁰Coral’s anthem**: Self-consumption as enlightenment (absurdity = wisdom).  

I dished out advice  
to a family of mice—  
‘make your own cheese,  
don’t just seek peace.  
What’s heaven’s girth  
without a full belly?’  

Hahaha—  
ohm-nom-nom, *anybody*?"*
