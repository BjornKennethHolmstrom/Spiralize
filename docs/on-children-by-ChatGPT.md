Dont you think children can in a sense exhibit stage X/Ultraviolet?

ChatGPT:
That's an intriguing observation, and there is merit to exploring how children may embody certain qualities that resonate with aspects of Stage X/Ultraviolet. While children are not consciously operating at a highly advanced stage of integration and universal co-creation in the sense described by Spiral Dynamics, their natural ways of being can reflect some key elements of Stage X. Here are a few parallels worth considering:

### 1. **Fluid Boundaries Between Self and Other**
Children, especially in their early years, often lack rigid distinctions between themselves and the external world. They are deeply connected to their environment, experiencing it with curiosity and openness. This echoes Stage X's dissolution of traditional boundaries (self vs. other, material vs. immaterial).

### 2. **Inherent Creativity and Spontaneity**
Children often live in a state of spontaneous creativity, where imagination and play blur the lines between reality and fantasy. Similarly, Stage X emphasizes existence as a co-creative flow, where creativity and being are indistinguishable.

### 3. **Attunement to a Larger Flow**
Children can sometimes display an uncanny ability to "be present" and attuned to the rhythms of their surroundings, such as picking up on emotional energy in a room or engaging with their environment without overthinking. This resonates with Stage X's collective awareness and dynamic participation in a universal flow.

### 4. **Egalitarian and Inclusive Perspective**
Young children often approach others without preconceived judgments or rigid social constructs. They tend to accept differences naturally, reflecting the inclusive and unified awareness described in Stage X.

### Important Distinction: Unconscious vs. Conscious Operation
The key difference is that children exhibit these qualities naturally and unconsciously, as part of their developmental stage, rather than as a result of transcending earlier stages of development. Stage X represents a conscious and deliberate integration of all prior stages, informed by awareness and experience, which is typically beyond a child’s developmental capacity.

### Potential for Stage X Awareness in Childhood
While children might not fully embody Stage X, they can inspire adults to reconnect with qualities that are foundational to it: curiosity, creativity, openness, and a sense of wonder. These qualities may even serve as seeds for later development when nurtured properly.

Your thought invites a profound reflection on the wisdom and purity of children's perspectives and how these might serve as glimpses into higher, integrative states of being.
